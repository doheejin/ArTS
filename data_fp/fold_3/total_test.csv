Most part of the poblation is happy because they success in life and catch up all the goals. A high percentage of poblation get stuck in their preoccupations and they cant see the light of the sun; they think that life hate them.

The scientist studies show us that a positive attitude help in life. A bunch part universities pass a lot of time doing research for understand the human mind and their attitudes.

2,2348,607A39D981DE,"Students and their families should consider any activitie that they want to get involved in school before getting in. If students get involve in many of them, then they will not have time to do any of their work from school. Not doing work from school will affect their grades , and they also wont be able to participate anymore, for having bad grades. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the student, should talk to the school and ask if it is posible for their kid to not participate in all of them because of the time, and other responsabilities they have. First of all students should talk to their parents before taking any desicion, them both need to consider that if the student gets involved in many activities, then they will not have time to do any work from school. If the students spend too much time on the activities, then he/she would not have time for them other responsabilities. The school should make an runion for parents, so they can agree on the terms that the school want. Activities at school should not be controling, or making the students join so many activities. If the student does not do the school work, then they will have bad grades, that will affect them by not being able to participate anymore in any of the school actiities. Students should not be able to participate in more than two activities at school. because they will get tired a lot, and therefore they will not do their homeworks. Participating in any of the activities should also be a credit for the students. Schools are responsable for any activite that it is happening in school, they should contact parents, and also have a reunion, so they would get the parents opinions. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the students, should considered any type of activitie that the student wants to get involved in. Participating in school it is good for students, but not when they do extraactivities. Some of the activities should be reunating with the students after school, and help them with any questio they have, or repasing anything that they didnt understand in the class. I think Schools should not control students involvents. Parents should be the ones desiding, and analizing before allowing their kids join any type of activitie in school. Students should not be able to participate in too many activities that would effect their grades. parents and school should agree on the desicions of wha is going to be better for the students.

In some societies, student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. First having a career in a young age,start work (having a job) and living by yourself. its like middle school and high school switch around youre pranging to live your life as adult instead living your life as teenage. At that age no one knows how to spend money or mange too. money is like water you have then spend it, all gone. Then the other choice not having a career in a young age,living their life to the fullness plus spending time with family and friends. you dont have to worry so much about paying bills and other things. Your family will support you no matter what happen,you could go out with friend. At this point you could spend more time on studying mostly importation on yourself.

5,2351,745F880CEFA7,When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on. Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know whats best for you. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you. Your parents also might have told you that to always tell the truth because its not good to lie. By asking alot of people for advice and hearing other peoples opinions and experiences throughout their lifetime you now know alot of information and advice from others with that you can make a better choices.,6,6,7,7,6,6,1512,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
6,2352,A7CC5A46675A,"In my opinion, most of the students are finish with their corse classe already by their junior year. Therefore, I think that having the program in our high school can benefit us. Some ways that it can benefit us by preparing us to go to college, it gives us more time to be with our family during the weekday, and it gives us time to work. Preparing for college, can be very emotional and physically exausted. Some of the reason is that we are worring on which college we want to study or does your ""GPA"" is sufficient good that any college will accept us. One example I have about getting ready to go to college is that once upon a time, my big brother was going to college and his GPA was 2.9 he was so anxious because he couldnt get to any if the colleges that he really wanted to go to. He kept searchign for colleges that offered a basketball course and he had found out that our school had a program for basketball. As soon as he found out he signed up and was accepted real quick. Another reason, on which its good to have programs in our school is that we can actually spend more time with our family because we will be able to be at our house earlier. One time I was at school and my sister was in the hospital but I could not be at the hospital with her because I had three sols that week. Everyday when I got out of school she was already asleep and wouldnt wake-up until the next morning, she had neumonia so we could barely talk a litlle bit. My point is that if I or my brother had the choice to be in the program we couldve be with our sister because we wouldve been out at 1:30pm. My last reason, is that having a program also helps us to have more time in the afternoon to work and help our family with families with their bills and their needs. We can also, save money for our college and for our selfs too. In my opinon, we have to work hard to get what we want, and what ever is that we are working for, will come with lots of blessings. In conclusion, we should have a program in our school so that we can grow more as professionals and have more responsabilties. We can prepare for college, be with our family, and work while we are in the program. Also, we can helps those who are still in ninth, tenth, or eleventh grade accompish their goals same way as we did but, we have to be thankful with those who helped us reached our goals.

7,2353,9B69DE203555,"When asking for advice, 93% of the people in America talk to more than one person. I think seeking multiple opinions will help you make a better choice rather than asking one person for advice. It could also help you out with other situations through out life. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you can get other peoples opinion. Everyone you know thinks differently. Sometimes people may have some of the same thoughts but not every situation has the same solution. What one person has to say is different from what another person says. People understand things differently. Some people you talk to will not understand your situation. They will not see the situation the way you see it. If they do not completely understand your situation they could say the wrong thing. When they say the wrong thing it could make your situation a lot worse. You should always have multiple people you know you can trust and you could talk with to ask for advice in any situation. While others will know exactly what to say and do because they probably have been in situations like yours. You can see other situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you start to see things differently. It changes the way you think about any situation. You will have an open mind and you will know what to say when other people ask you for advice. Knowing what to do when other people ask you for advice can help you out with a lot through life. It can help build stronger relationships and people can trust you. Trust is very important because people can talk to you about anything and you will know how to react and what to say. In conclusion, talking to more than one person to ask them for advice can help you make the better choice. It can also help you out with other situations later in life. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently.

8,2354,47261D6E0F08,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something?. We accomplish excellent grades at school by studying , at sports by practicing everyday and never giving up to become an amazing player, and at work by learning and giving a lot of effort to realize our goals. First of all, students stay after school or ask for a raise pass to study more about the subject they have a test or quiz. In the actuality, there is a lot of schools from South America like Peru, Chile, Bolivia, etc. that do not have after school or raise pass for students to study more. Some students have to pay approximate 30 dollars per hour for a personal teacher to help them at home. Students from South America do not have the facility to study with their teachers without paying for extra classes. Another example, when I came to United States, there was a day that I had an important test, and I did not know nothing about the topic. So, I stayed after school with my teacher, and we practiced a lot. When I took the test, I answered all the questions without problem. The next day, my teacher gave me back the test and I was the highest grade of the class. That made me stayed more often at school with my teachers to study different classes. Furthermore, to get good grades, students have to do homework, projects, and participate a lot in class. Secondly, it is important for people that want to get better at sports to practice everyday to become an excellent player. Additionally, people success in sports, when they never give up and try to learn by their mistakes. When I was in Generic_City, at school I was part of a volleyball team, and we played against another school. That day, I was not ready to play with the other school. My team lost the game because I did not played good. I did not want to play anymore, because I was scared of losing again. But I did not give up because I was fascinated with this sport and I kept practicing and becoming better at volleyball. I know that the best way to success at sports is practicing all the time, and never give up in something that you love. I learned that if I stayed in inactivity, and do not practice, I would never become a good player in volleyball. Finally, people accomplish at work when they do new projects to grow the company each day. Another reason is, people have to be responsible with their duties at work. Besides, if you want to get a higher level position, then you can do it by learning more about your job and showing your effort and hard working everyday. In this days, is hard to get a good and stable job because it requires effort and knowledge, but being active and always doing something to make a wonderful work will let you find an amazing job. By the other hand, being idle can give you bad consequences like, you can be fired, never find a job or never be successful in life. I am sure that most people accomplish more when they study at school to get good grades, at sport when they practice and believe in themselves to become an extraordinary player, and at work when they learn and give a lot of effort to fulfill their goals.

First of all, you will never know everything but the most important things is trying because if you dont try, you will never learn, but sometime its okay to be failure without a enthusiasm that means that you dont care, you are not interesting in anything or another way to see that dont have a enthusiasm is when you waste time for example if i feel like i am just losing every time and i dont even has a enthusiasm, something to be focus, I will enjoy my time to try to better, to be a winner I always will be try to increase. Secondly, some time people love to be a better person but there will be people who doesnt enjoy the time to increase, I just know one thing for sure sometime people like to stay in the same step because if you want to be a winner, you must try and see what you can do to go up, I will try to have a good future, a better future for my family, to have my own things, living failure make you a weak person everyone can see that you are weak, that you are not smart enough , that you are comfortable for what you have, but you must be a ambition person to have more than what you have.

10,2356,3FD4C280E4EF,"Summer Prompt Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information easily when they return in the fall. I think summer should not change because it would have a negative impact on students; such as, not enjoy summer time. Some people argue that there should be a year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. Some student said that break during school year sounds good; however, they would enjoy better summer time because of the weather. In personals experiences, I enjoyed summer break better then winter break because in summer I was available to play outside; in the other hand, during winter break I wasnt available to play outside because the weather was too cold. Student also think that they enjoy summer break better because they dont have the pressure of homework, and after school activities. I think summer break is long enough for those who need extra help, so they can attend to summer school. I enjoy summer break because it is also the part of the year where days are longer enough to expend time with friends. I also enjoy summer break because it is the only par of the year where I can spent time fishing, which is what I enjoy the most. I think having certain of breaks during school year will make difficult for student to concentrate. Think you dont understand a topic in algebra; you get some help, and finally you start to understand it, but you realize that fall break is next week, and it will interrupt with your learning. I think thats a consequence of having certain of breaks during school year. There should not be a short summer break because it is the only time people spend the most time with their family. I think thats the most important think of summer; spend time with the family. It is also the part of the year that people get off their stress. People is adapted with the school program and they will not like the idea of having it change. I think the society is adapted with the system that we have currently.

This can benefit eveyone on the group because all can share ideas ,we can work in the difirents parts at the same time, they have more time on the breaks ,and they have more time to review the work and checks if there is a problem. I notice doing in group is more efficient and can help improve the working on the on projects or works. First, I think that share ideas with the group will benefit you and all the group. So, they all can have ideas to continue and do not minds in blanc. This will be helpful for the groups because we are more efficient than do it separate. Also, I think this benefit every one on the group to do not get struggle because we are out of ideas. I know that working in group is a benefit because every one in the group is having more breaks than they will have doing separate . Also , this help every one in the group because we are less probable to stress because we all have more times on the breaks to be relax. although, they can work in differents are of the work at the same time. So, every one working in different parts benefit they because they are working faster and efficient. I think we can get more time to help each other on the work and this is great because we learned and help the group to have a good work. Every one doing this in group is a benefit and helpful way. So, doing this in group is helpful because every one can check differents part of the work and look if they find a mistake.

On the other hand, other people believe that self-esteems comes from achievements. I think that self-esteems comes from both learning and achievements, but it mostly come by telling a students that there work is good for these three reasons. One reason is that people are giving good complement to student for their work that the student have done, sometime people would want to have the stuff the students would create, and last people would say nice thing to students so the other people wouldnt hurt their feeling. The first reason is that people are complementing to student for their work that student have created. Some people would say nice things and walk away or they would stay and talk about what the student made and the meaning behind what the student created. I remember when I was a little kid, I built a toy car and my mom like it. So when im older, I want to create my own car and show my mom how good I am at building cars. My mom was the one who has help me boost my self-esteem. That is what teachers should do to student if they want to boost their self-esteem. Another reason, is that sometime people would want to have the stuff that students would create. For example, say if you made a painting and someone on the street saw it. Then the person would want to buy it and you sold it to him. That would make you want to create even more painting and sell it. It would make the student think that the person like your painting that you created and that boost you into selling more painting. The more stuff you create. The more people would want to buy it. That is an another reason to help boost students self-esteems. The last reason is that people would say nice thing so they wont hurt your feeling, But they do that because there jealous that they cant do the stuff that you can create. There are some people in the world that just give you hateful comment about your creation. And that doesnt mean that you can stop doing what you want to do. It doesnt matter because there are other people that are gonna like the thing that you create. There are people out there that maybe want to buy your stuff probably even a famous person would want to buy it. In conclusion, people would try to believe in students so they could have self-esteem.

17,2363,D10BBD82D66F,"Former Primer Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", and in my opinion I agree with Churchills words. Failure has a enormous role in success. Failure is all about, learning from the mistakes you made and gaine all the experience you can out of it, Not giving up and plan what can you do better to accomplish what you have been fighting for to get even better results that the ones you were expecting in the first place, that is what failure is all about and that is why it has big and important a role in the pursuit of success. Learning from the mistakes that were done is a big example of the role that failure has on the pursuit of success; throughout history there had been many times were our society, nation, and specie had learned from their mistakes; as an example of this is the League of Nations, it was created after WWI to maintain worldwide peace; It end up being a big failure. we learned from this and the U.N was created to maintain global peace through nations and till present days it stills been one of societies biggest success. this is an example of how learning from mistakes you have made in the past is useful but overall this is one of many examples you can put to show how failure is related to success. Not giving up is also really important on this because giving up is not an answer as an example of this is, Pele, he became one of the best soccer players in history but it also became the youngest player to win a world cup, since a really small age he was told that he was never going to become a soccer player, he was told numerous time that his talent was not enough, but he did not gave up, he gave all he had and when he had the chance he showed everyone of what he was capable of and became one of the best players in the world. In his debut on first world cup he suffered an injury on his knee while training for the first match, it let him out for half of the of world cup. Doctors told him that he had to do exercise every day to get better, but that he was not going to be able to play in the whole tournament; he did not give up he trained day after day and in the third phase of the world cup he was given an opportunity to play in one of the games. This is a great example of the strength that people have when they do not give up and they give all they are capable of. This is also a great example that shows how failure has many things directly related at helping people to success at what they are trying to achieve. Another example of how failure can help you success is trying once more. this is the most important feature in the relationship of failure and success because once you have looked back at what you did wrong last time and learning from that, you are ready to try once more and accomplish what you have been fighting for. As an example of this is the spaceships that have send to space to reach many places in the universe. Its well known that many of the spaceships that have been send to space failed, and in really big proportions. Many of those spaceships exploded do to problems on their systems or other problems. After many tries looking at what failed and what went wrong humans were able to send satellites and people to the outer space, it took many failures to till we got all of this finished, now we are able to send spaceships throughout the galaxy to explore the stars and many other places. failure taught us what were we doing wrong, and we learned from it, this shows us of how failure is related to success by trying many times to achieve what you are fighting to achieve. Many people believe that failure is not related in any way to success, they have arguments saying that, you can accomplish something at the first try, that you do not learn anything from the mistake or the times you have failed at something, and they also say that you lose all enthusiasm when you fail numerous times at something. I believe this people are wrong because you do not always accomplish something in the first try, and you always learn from your mistakes, you might learn valuable lessons out of them; their last argument can be denied by telling to yourself that you can do it, we decide when do we lose our enthusiasm or not. this is why I believe they are wrong failure is related in the pursuit of success even if we want it or not because you learn and gain experience out of it, that is what makes this world a better place, failure, and it might sound like is not true but I believe it is; failure is always there and we can always learn valuable lessons out of it. Like I stated in my examples above failure is related to success; failure is not a bad thing because we learn from the mistakes we have done, we can gain experience out of it, we learn what are we doing wrong, but what we have to keep in mind is that we decide if we lose the enthusiasm in something whenever we decide to do it, this is why I believe that the words that Winston Churchill said are true, because from failure to failure we learn from the mistakes we made along the way to success, we can think of a better plan with the things we learned and after that we can try once more to accomplish the thing we have failed with better results that those we were expecting. That is why I think that failure is related to success. ",7,7,8,7,6,6,2885,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

19,2365,F90A25704212,"Have you ever been in class unsure about what your learning even though you have been paying attention? Im sure that would be majority of upper classmen students. I can admit Ive have been several of times, In my opinion distance learning is a wonderful idea. Students can move at their own pase , you can replay the lesson video as much as needed , and it will prevent you from failing a class. School can be stressful expecially when you miss a day and you feel like your behind on everything. Then when the teacher explains it to you , If you dont understand you might not want to ask for him/her to repeat it again. This can be avoided by the power of distance learning youll be able to have classes online so you can move at your own paste. You wouldnt have to worry about asking a staff or classmate what you missed. Also you can take notes and do your classwork whichever way it works best for you. However some students are visual and independent learners they focus better when they work by themselves. Working in a group at times might not always be the best option. When reviewing for a test or quiz you can go back and reread ,study, and take notes on whatever youre struggling with. Those notes can be reviewed as much as you want. If youre a type of person that has to have things repeated to you multiple times this is a great opportunity for you. Last but not least , Are you failing a class due to not having enough time to turn your work in? You would probably not have to worry about that anymore because you can do your work at anytime. In class you are given a time limit you have to turn in your assigment. When your doing it online yes im sure there is a due date but youre not told what time your suppose to start at. If your at sports practice or have any free time you can start working on it. In my opinion this will prevent you from failing a class because you can turn it in whenever your ready to. To sum it up this is an amazing opportunity alot of students should be looking to attend. If your school is offering this to you I highly recommend it. It can keep you on track and motivate you to complete and turn your work in on time so you dont fall behind in class. You can move at your own paste without anyone rushing you. And lastly, you can replay and reread anything as you would like with no limits. This is a big help for students who want to reach their goal of earning a diploma.

20,2366,F531D21A72F6,"The success is achieve something, is like a goal that we want reach. Nobody is perfect in this life, at contrary all the people make mistakes.

As a result of this mistake the food obtain a different flavor, but of this failure I can learn and upgrade my skills like a chef. Another example could be: when a student fail in a test, but has the chance to take a retake, is there when the student spend all their time studying to get a better grade. Daily the people commit diverse mistakes, but depend of us to determine if this mistakes will define us. Also we can take with enthusiasm this kind of failures and learn from them. Dont give up, we have to be strong. That a mistake dont stop you of achieve your goals. A characteristic of the humans is that we try to overcome all the challenges that we have in our life.

21,2367,1BC40A063549,"I am agree with this prompt, i think that everyone have to believe in their self-reliance, Because we have to follow our own ideas to be a unique person and believe in our decision in the life. the only way that you can be a successful on your job or on your life is believing in your own ideas and value your self-reliance, and never think that you cannot do nothing because you can. the only thing that you have to do is believe in your own instincts and ideas and dont let other to tell you something different. i will like to reckon in my self-reliance to be a better person in this world and dont depend of other person to get my dreams. (people who believe and value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas). 1-the school is one good example for this is because the school give you exams and work for do on your own self, - the school give you a lot of challenge one of them are the tests, for get good grates on those test you have to self-reliance to study and pass those test. 2-the work (jobs) is other best examples,they give you the opportunity to show them that you are a excellent employee and that you can create your own ideas. -the work is other place to explain the self-reliance, your boss is asking you if you can do a work for him and that work is important for him because he ask to other workers but they copy the work from other company so he belief that you can do the things better that other and you have to self-reliance for that work and create your own ideas for it. 3- on my own life, the idea to choose what we have to do on the future is because our parent want that us get the best opportunities but sometimes we dont want to do the things that our parent tell us because we want to do the best thing for be the best but not like they want we want to do the thing on my own way. conclusion i believe that, we always have to self reliance because, that help you doing things that you never imagine that you could do that, and never keep focus in just one thing, put your mind open for make better decisions and follow your instincts for do the best that you can, my conclusion is that you always have to believe in your self-reliance and always follow your dreams for more hard that those things can be but that is the opportunity for your self-reliance and show that you can do the things that you want if you bring your ideas and follow your dreams.",7,6,5,5,6,6,365,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
22,2368,EA03135D3C88,"Student-designed Wouldn`t it be exciting for a student to create a summer projects for their fellow students to do during summer break? Summer break is a time for students to have fun with their families and friends. It a time to travel to so many places like Generic_City, Florida, California, and so forth. Furthermore, it`s great for students to complete summer projects during their break so their brains and memories can still be refreshed and for them not to forget most of the school materials they have learned before summer break. Moreover, requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a brilliant idea. But these summer projects should be student-designed because the projects will be exciting, students will be more engaged with the projects, and the student-designed projects will definitely be less harder. The first reason the summer projects should be a student-designed is because the projects will be exciting and enjoyable for other students. For example, when a students designs a Kahoot for their fellow students to use to study for their test and quizzes, it will be exciting just because the students will get to choose any names they wish. So, a Kahoot is a game that teachers use to create a test or quizzes for students to study to get them prepared for their test and quizzes. The Kahoot can be used inside and outside of the school premises. The student designing the kahoot will get to choose how many seconds or minutes it should take the students to answer their questions. Also, most teachers don`t give students enough time for them to choose their answers and that is unfair. Students needs more time at least 20 to 30 seconds to think about the questions before answering and not rush to choose any answer just because the teacher didn`t give them enough time. Students complain about how much time teachers give them because they need more time to work on their projects. For instance, teachers design boring projects like making a word puzzel about math. That is so boring because no students wants to spend their time making a word puzzle about math instead of doing other fun things like reading, going to the movie theater, going on vacation, and spending time with their families and friends. Most of the students don`t find math interesting beccause they don`t like doing math. Another reason is that students will be more engaged with the projects. For instance, a student designed a project about each students choosing their own topic argumentative essay like increasing the minimum wage, the college tuition, and discrimination. After that, the student will design another projects about presentations. The presentation will teach them how to present to their fellow students and also how to present in future times like jobs. The presentation will also help them master the skills of presenting. When a student designs the projects, the student will give the students extra time to work on it because teachers will give students less time on their project and expect the students to be prepared when they are not. Furthermore, the students will decide if they need to present to teachers because most students are nervous to do that. And also they have not mastered the skill of presenting yet. The students will also decide how many words will be in each slides, how many slides they need, and how many minutes they need to present. Most of the times, teachers give students less time to present. Due to the less time, students won`t be able to finish what they have in mind or what they have to say and they will have to be rushed to finish before time is over. And if the students didn`t reach the time given or went over the time given, points will be deducted. But when the students chooses how they want their presentations to be, they are more likely to work on it more than when a teacher tells them how to do their own presentations. The third reason is because the student-designed project will be less harder for students to do. For example, there was a project my history teacher assigned us to do, it was a project about the Progressive Era to make sure that we understand what it was all about. We had to come up with a creative title and 3 categories for the project. It was hard for us to do because we had to come up with a creative title that connects with the topic and 3 categories that 20 sub-heading can fit on one of them. If it was a student designed the project, it would be less harder because either the title is given to us, or we don`t have to create one. And also the 3 categories will be given to use to make it a little more easier. Then all we have to do is put the 20 sub-heading in their right categories and also insert some images where it suppose to be. Another example was when my AVID teacher gave a project about researching the college of our choice. It`s great that we had to choose the college of our choice, but the questions and the rubric was unclear. They were almost the same question and it was difficult for us to answer it because we couldn`t give the same answer to all the questions. Even though some people say that teacher-designed will be so much better because students will tend to take it seriously than a student-designed; however, student-designed is better because its made by a student and it will less stressful, while teacher-designed will be a lot harder and frustrating to do. In conclusion, student-designed is better because its more fun, engaging, and easier to do than teacher-designed. Students need more time towork on their projects while spending time with families and friends. It`s great to have fun while learning and not stress out over a project during summer break. Schools need to give students an opportunities for them to design a projects for their follow students, and to show their skills and talents.

What does onmanpia mean? Its an sound affect you would see when you are reading a book or watching a cartoon here are some examples for this word the owl whoosh away flying as quick whoosh is a sound affect when watching a cartoon you could seen the character falling then you see the word boom when he falls. People really get confused with simile or metaphor when they see it or and personafaction and hyperbaly it almost means the same thing but they are not. Onmanpia it the easiest but hard the write half of the people that first start to learn this have a hard time one. saying its name or two. writing it because for sure I did. What is simile? well simile is when there is like or as in it there are ways like he is as sad as the clouds there are two thing they are comparing it too and it has as but metaphor could have as or like in it but still wouldnt be a simile. You could say as I was walking I stumble across an old friend of mine your using as in the sentence thats a metaphor. It is important for you to know this so when you are reading or watching t. v or something this lesson will remind you about what you just learned. Personafaction is a long and confusing word but the meaning for this long word is almost the same as hyperbaly yall already know whats the meaning but personafiction is used in sentences like the clouds dont look very happy they look mad the meaning for this is that it looks like its about to rain. really tricky to not get hyperbaly or personafaction correct.,4,5,5,4,5,4,1856,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 4"
24,2370,D7766B98F761,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I believe that attitude is everything in life. Having a negative attitude can be helpful when someone is defending themselves for what they believe in, but having a positive attitude might change someones life and at the end of the day you feel good about yourself. Its important to have a positive attitude in everyday life because your reputation goes up, others want what you have and you set a positive mindset for yourself. First, having a positive attitude in your daily life will raise your reputation. For example, you are at a job interview, you dress very properly for this job interview. When you first walk in the room, you greet the interviewer with a smile and a handshake, and you start to introduce yourself. That gives the perfect first impression to getting the first place in this job. People in my life have taught me that giving positive attitude around my peers is very important, because having a positive attitude can change what someone think of you. In summary, being positive in a job interview will get you that job that youve been working for your whole life. Second, people around you want what you have when you show positive attitude. For example, you are doing a group project, you dont know any of the people you are working with. The first thing that you did was to introduce yourself with a big smile, and then you ask for their names. All those people in your group sees that enthusiasm, and they think "" Man! She must be a really nice peson, I wish I have that kind of positivity in my life."" Someone in that group might not been having a good day that day and they saw how positive you are and they want that same positivity that you have. In summary, a person giving another person positive attitude can help others to be the best that they can be in life. Third, having a positive attitude can set your mind on positive things in life. For exmaple, in 1999 there was a shooting in Generic_School, 200 people died and 500 people were injured. It was a very sad event for both families and friends. A girl name Generic_Name was injured badly that she has to be in a hospital. But what she said in the hospital that caught everyones attention was that "" I may be hurting very badly right now and I may or may not be able to walk, but I am glad that I am still alive, and that i get to see my friends and familys faces right now"". Generic_Name was injured so bad that she couldnt even walk, but she had that positive mindset that at least shes not dead. In summary, positive attitude will switch your life around in lifes hardest moments. In Conclusion, positive attitude is the key to happiness and success in life. One person being positive about something, the others follow. Thats what so special about positivity, it spreads everywhere you go, as long as you are positive. This changes peoples lives every single day. When someone have positive attitude, your reputation goes up, people want that positivity and you have a positive mindset in everything you do.

25,2371,0F32DDCBECB6,"It is important try to do your best for conserve energy and resources. But, I am disagree that my school follow this model and change to a four day school week and extend the school day two hours. Even if maybe it can have some benefits but as student i think it can have many disadvantages for us. And if we want to conserve energy and resources we can do it follow others methods. I am not in favor of that my school follow this model for some reasons. First, thIs proposal could affect most to the students in many ways for example if they extend the school day two hours I think it is to much time at school it will be so stressful for the students and teachers as well. Another reason is because many students have to work a part time after school. So, if they extend the school day two hours is possible that the students who have to work after school will can work only few hours and some of them really need to work after school becase maybe they live by themself and they have to pay rent and anothers bills it means they need the money. Then, this students who have to support by themself maybe they will can not go to school any more if the school accept this new proposal because they have to work . Another disadvantage is that it will be stessfull if we have to do our homework after have been almost whole day at school. Next, some students have to help their parents after school for example they have go to pick up their little brothers from school and take care of them or they have to cook, clean up the house, wash diches, do the loundry and other stuff. So, if the students have to do this things they will dont have time to do their homework. Then, those students who have to work or help their parents after school will be so affect if the school follow this model maybe their grades will decrease because they dont do their homework or they dont sleep well if they dont sleep well they will be distract and not paying attention in classes. Another reason why i am not in favor is because sometimes maybe we want to hang out with friends, go visit your family and spend time with them but if we leave late school maybe we will be tired or have things at home to do. So, we will not have a time for that and sometime we need time for ourself, time to rest but if we have work, do homework, school we can not it is so stressfull. Then, the students will not concentrate at school nor work. There are some benefits too for example for some students who dont have to work or help their parents after school so they can rest when they get back from school and they will have time to do their homework. Also they can hang out with his friends or go visit his families on weekends. Another benefit is that if we have only four day school the students will have one day left that can use to work all day or do other things like homeworks, go play soccer or other things for fun. So, with this model we can have 3 days without school and work those days and study thet other four days if we live with our parents or someone who support us then if the schooIl follow this model wll not affect us and it is a great option. In conclusion i am disagree to my school follow this model because i think it will afect the student and as student i want to be successful and reponsible with my homeworks. Also, for those students who have to work they have to be competent in their jobs to not get fire because they need the money.

26,2372,7EA986233EDA,"One of minister Winston Churchill most famous quotes is ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Some people think that most people are consists on going with failure as a way that shows us that most people end up with failure again. They feel that its true most people end up failing and end up doing the same process over and over again. I believe that most of the people should believe that success can be achieved only if you try but you will end up failing some of the times because first reason some people give up so easily and second reason theyll never give it their best some of the times and final reason is that people end up saying ""its too difficult"". First reason is that people most of the times end up giving up is because of the lack of things such as work or other sorts of jobs it could also be anything in life that people will give up on. It could be like saying its a job and your been stressing out so much that you couldnt take it anymore so you decided to just call it quits, but for this problem people should always try there best and never let any other problems get into the way of their accomplishment, all ways stay positive and never lose on what you enjoy like giving up on it. Second reason could be is that people dont ever try giving it their best its always a been a problem cause some of the times people end up saying im not going to even try. youll need to give it your best and try to give it all you got it could be on a test or it could also be on another problem in life by doing this you could achieve on being successful and end up doing great with no struggle or bad choices. Final reason is that people end up saying that ""its to difficult"" but by showing this people can make it difficult on themselves by not focusing or doing what your supposed to it can be in some situations where you have difficult times but in the end if you end up following direction or staying on task it could led to having a successful accomplishment. As you have read that people should have any other way but to be always successful and always trying your best, you will end up failing but its always good to never giving up. Only when will we ever end up failing that will always find a way to end up doing it correctly. On that day will we ever have to worry about failing.",7,5,7,6,6,6,1668,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

29,2375,AE0DB193F5B5,"Today, in the actuality, a lot of people have a big dreams that we can to complete have a better life for our future family or also to own self but a many people be surrender becuase most of the time have the fuilures, when they are doing something; I think that our life without the fuilures will be bored and easy becuase we dont have the energies to work hard or fight for our goals or dreams. I agree with Churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because you can help other to complete their dreams or their goals, also you can have more spirit and a positives attitudes than you have in the begging, also you can be a successful and strong person. You can help others to complete with their dreams or their goals, because sometimes a lot of people who want to comply their dreams or goals they dont have the motivation of their families or the economy necessary to buy all the studies or all the things that they need, so when you finish all the goals that you make you, you can assist to others. I know an experience of child from Mexico, his name was Generic_Name. Generic_Name was a child with the low economy resources, I remember that he toll us all the things that he was comply to get a better life for his family and him self. So one day, Generic_Name received a big notice from a presidency of Generic_City, the place were we live, that he can have a opportunity to study whatever he want. He and his family were happy for the big opportunity that Generic_Name have. At pass of the years, when Generic_Name finished study the collage, I know that Generic_Name is a big entrepreneur from a big company that he created after finished the college. Today, also Generic_Name likes help other people who want to be a successful in their life like the presidency help him. In my observation to be a good person likes Generic_Name makes that you have a lot of open opportunities to get the success or the things that Generic_Name every day was dreamed. Also you can be a successful and strong person because all people knows that the life is not easy and less if you want to do something hard or something that you need put a lot of time in it to pursuit of success and if you think that your goals or dreams are difficult to complete. Sometimes we need strive more that the people or your mind think. Another of my experiences is when was in Mexico, I was little girl, I remember that most of my days I talked with my family, my mother, my father and also sometimes with my grandfathers; about that I want study the High School in Untied States because I saw a TV Shows and movies shows all the schools and also my father lived a lot of years in this country so, he talk me about the schools, the teachers, the classmates, the classes and classrooms that were to different form my country, the lunch time and I think that the thing that was more exercise was with the lockers because in my country dont have lockers or something to put our things likes books, pencils, notebooks and sometimes, the food. At the time that was grow up, I was continue with the same mentality to come to this country to comply my studies. I remember that have a lot of failures in the time to the arrival to United States but,even if never let that my thoughts or the commentaries of the negative people will be fell bad about my big dream. I think that was a strong person because is hard to come to other place with different culture and customers in everything and also is hard and sad separate to the persons who love. Other might say that the importance role that failure plays in the pursuit of success does not matter or they are disagree because you can lose your forces to continue and accomplish your goals and sometimes this failure can make us fell sad. However, you can have more spirit and positives attitudes than you have in the begging because when you have a failure in something that you study a lot or put your all time in it, you can have the mentality that you can to do well it, just you need strive a little be more that you make before. This is one of my experiences in my life; the last week, in my History class with Generic_Name, we have a quiz form the first unit so, we did the quiz, but the majority of my classmates and me, we dont pass the quiz, my teacher talked with us to give us a another opportunity to pass it. A lot of my classmates tell her that they do not were think that they can pass it even though they study a lot before the retake but, I have the spirit and the positives attitudes that I can passed the quiz with a good grade and study well at home. I think that my experience, it is good example because a lot of people who want to complete their dreams does not matter the times that they need to try to get a good result and a good recompense for the effort that they make. In my opinion, I think that Churchills statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" it is important and I agree with it because you can motive other people to be a good person with good feelings and goals, another reason is because you can to be a successful and respectful person and you can have a good attitudes through haved a bad results, every time you need stay be happy.

30,2376,E98FABC326F7,"ways to help improve students achievements in after school clubs. after school homework clubs would be helpful because students can understand more about what they are doing, for example when a student has difficulty in one of there subjects,and they need help they can stay after school to get a better understanding on what they need help on. other ways after school clubs would help the students focus more on the certain problems they need, but over all after school homework clubs is a great way for students to express there knolage and there concern on what help they might need help on over all. after school homework club can help know the children strength and weakness for example me when I stay back for math after school my teacher helps me know what I need to work on to decrease my weakness for instance, me and my math teacher she helps me go throw steps to learn easy ways to decrease my weakness in different problems that I dont understand. other ways she helps me on to decrease my weakness is by giving real life problems and showing me ways to solve them and getting the questions right . having after school clubs can help teachers and the students know were there strength and weakness are. the after school club can help classmates have one on one conversations on what they understand and do not understand learning from other people can help you because they might know problems that you dont understand but they do. like for instance my friends at my school they get more help from classmates then they do teachers. having a after school club for students can bring a positive impact on them and others around them and also it can be fun.

31,2377,F100483B6259,"Can you imagine someone that want to study more and to get more knowledge? Well, many people do want to continue studying because the more knowledgeyou know, you will have a more benefits in your life. Furthermore, like the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Hes because we never stop learning the little things in life such as: explore the world and to never stop your dream of continue your study. I agree with Emersons statement because we want to get in our goal in the survey and to never stop growing with mentality. First reason is that we have to explore the world. For example, by exploring the world we will know like the different cultures of each country or by having friends that are different country. Like my mom always said ""You have to get out of the box to learn more, to see and explore what you have at your surroundings"". Second, to never stop your dream of continue your study. For instance, if you want to grow mentally you have to study more to get the knowledge you want. The more knowledge you have, then the more great will be your job or even more better you can be your own boss. However, people will never grow if they dont continue their survey. Finally as you can see, Emersons statement ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is true because we will never stop learning, and the more you study the more knowledge you will know.

32,2378,B76C582FA08B,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. But are students really doing educational purposes? Should students really use their phones in their classrooms? Are students actually getting education? This is what I think about cell phones used in classes. Most students get distracted by using their cell phones especially in class. I feel like every school should at least have laptops to give out for their students. Its more easier and less distracted. Because a lot of websites are blocked. Everyone gets distracted I know but thousand of teen are obsess with their phones. And if youre a teacher and let your student do their ""work"" in their cell phone, just know they might not be doing their ""work"" in their cell phones. Some students might care more about their education then the things thats going on in life. Maybe not everyone feels the same, thinks the same, are the same. They might be capable to use their cellphones without getting distracted. Most of us can handle the distracting than others. Most teachers actually let their students use their phones and dont really pay attention to their students. It might be our responsibility to be on track. But i feel like the teachers should at least stop us from getting distracted. Most students do get mad at teachers when the teachers stop us from using our devices. But do students know it for our own good. When my parents take my phone away. I feel more free, relax, I feel good to be honest. I do get a bit mad at first. But then I think why they took it and how many time I lost. I feel like im back in reality and just leaving my moment god gave me. Honestly cell phones had ruined many peoples lifes. Even toddlers these day all they do is come back from school and play on their parents cell phones or their losing sleep to watch videos . I honestly dont think cell phones are healthy at all not even in education. Teachers shouldnt let their students use their phones at all. Only if its in an emergency. Than thats when they should let them use it. But a real emergency. Thats what I think about teachers letting their students use their cell phones during classes.

Teacher: when are you take the video online you dont have a teacher for tell you what do you need do in the class ,and him cant help in your work for example the teacher cant help with kahoot or quizlet or with others strategies of work . Organized: when you take the class online you dont have organized, if you need highlights or pensil for write something for read it or explain your work.

34,2380,D9469EFAE287,"Im going to start explaining and giving my opinion, Technology is one of the main reasons, why the world is changing and accommodating with the necessities that the person have, for example: we live in a community that if everything is easier is better, few years ago people had to walk hours or days to go some where, on this days the transport is a lot easier because the technology had increased, you can use or have your own car or you, can take the public transport and go everywhere with out problems and if you want to go to another country you can! because the air lines exist now, and you can fly to go to the country you like. So technology have a positive effect because is helping us to make our daily necessities at home or everywhere better, a reason why i think that is because the future of the students is going to be with more opportunities to learn what they like, with out saying excuses, the help of others is not going to be that necessary with technology in your hands; no body have to advocate for you with your problems and decisions. Technology is going to be increasing, For example years ago you could not talk to your family or friends if they were too far away from you, in that edge the only thing you could do was write a letter and send it through mail and then the people who was waiting for it has to wait like one or two months; for have that note, but all that had changed too, When the telephone was invented people start buying and using, that invent, for the public in general the telephone start to be necessary for the people for emergencies like call the ambulance or call the police in case that something dangerous could be happen; years before, the history of the telephone became with new ideas like you can not just call with the telephone because is has be made it smart you can take pictures play read book and more, today the telephone have a drastic change is nothing like the old phone is something different. technology had changed our way to communicate and transport and a lot more.",7,6,7,7,6,6,3040,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
35,2381,FBE8983EF69C,"Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity at school, Did you enjoy it? In todays day and age there are tons of extracurricular activities and even maybe some you never heard about. Its always nice to give something a try even if you have never done it before. You could even join something that you have already done before and that your good at. For example, if you are good at basketball you could join the basketball club and have fun doing what you like. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends. My first reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they gain new experiences. Its always nice to try something that youve never done before. For example, lets say you have no experience in cooking and theres a cooking club you can join. By joining that club you could learn about different foods and how to cook them. Those cooking skills that you learned could take you a long way or help you with something simple like cooking you or somebody else some food at home. Another example could be joining a club that has to do with the wild and things like nature. You could learn about things like how to make a fire or what plants are dangerous and which are not. There could even be some hands on experiences like fields trips to go camping or just explore the wilderness. These could help you if you ever wanted to go camping on your own later on in the future. These are just some of the things you would get to experience joining new clubs,there are so many more. My second reason that students should join extracurricular activities is that it could help with their health. If students join a club they will be surrounded by other students and this will help them stay socially active. Instead of being at home in a dark room playing video game or on their phones, they could be talking other students and enjoying the activities in the club. Its always nice to have people surrounding so that way your not alone. Being alone could lead to things like depression or social anxiety and no student should have to go through any of those things. Another way it could help with their health is by joining a sports club. By joining any sports club students will be getting at least forty minutes to a hour of daily exercise. This exercise that the students are getting could help them with things like weight loss or just trying to stay in shape. Its always good to try and maintain good health and these are some great ways to do it. My third and final reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they can make new friends. By joining these extracurricular activities students may meet other students they have never seen before. This could be a opportunity for them to be able to make new friends. On top of that, they could most likely have the same interests as they chose the same club or activity. For example if they joined soccer they may have a interest in soccer and they could build off of that. Once they become friends they could do things like help each other in school or maybe even hang out. They could even introduce each other to other friends that they have. For example, One student could ask the friend he made in the Art club if he wanted to sit with him during lunch and now that the student has been introduced and they can all be friends now. Making friends is always a good and fun thing to do. Overall, extracurricular activities are a good thing for students. Whether its if your making friends, helping out your health, or even learning new experiences. Extracurricular activites are a big help to students. They should be encouraged to join and try them. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends.",8,9,9,9,9,8,3814,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
36,2382,5B40AA0E6C2B,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude of the people. I think is very important to be positive and has a good attitude with everybody. In the other head, many people likes the people that has a positive attitude. For example when I was in my country Generic_City. There is a woman call Generic_Name she have a small restaurant in the park front to her house . She was sell I say was because I dont know if she still has the restaurant. However In the restaurant she was sell many type of food. For example soup, chicken, pupusas and Generic_Name need someone to help her with the restaurant job. And there is a woman her name is Generic_Name she is very smart however she has a bad attitude with every body. She went to apply for the restaurant job and she has a good experience in the restaurant. And there is other woman name Generic_Name she is very nice and she always try to help others in the community also she has a positive attitude with the people. Generic_Name call Generic_Name and Generic_Name Because Generic_Name want to interview. Also she want meet they and see how they are and what they know about work in a restaurant. The fist woman the come to Generic_Name house was Generic_Name she dont say good morning she just went to Generic_Name and say I am interesting in the job. Generic_Name was very surprising because her just ask for the job don""t in troduce herself and Generic_Name told her that she already has someone to help her in the restaurant. Generic_Name just say ok bye. After one hour Generic_Name come to Generic_Name House and she say good Morning I am Generic_Name it is here where they are hearing someone to help work in a restaurant. Generic_Name told her yes so Generic_Name was talking with Generic_Name and Generic_Name know that Generic_Name know a little about work in a restaurant bout she notice that she is smart and with the time she well be learn fast and she well be appreciate the opportunity that Generic_Name is give to her. Also Generic_Name has a positive attitude went she was speaking with Generic_Name. In fact I think has a positive attitude is the key to success in life. For example, few days ago my father was very worry because he has just two days to finish one of the big job the he has. He was thinking to ask my brother if he has time to came help him. My brother told him that he is going to help him and he look at my father he was very worry and he ask my father what is happen why he look worry. my father told him that is for the job that he has he just has two days to finish and my brother always has a positive attitude and he told my father to dont worry that everything is going to be okay. And he is going to do his best to help him with the job. He is going to do the more fast that he can and he is going to ask his friends to came and help hem with his big project. After two days they finish the job on time. And My father boss was so happy that they do a great job and my father was very proud of my brother because he has a positive attitude and he believe in his self. This is why I think that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Because is help to win many things with the family and other persons.",5,5,5,6,4,4,1181,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
37,2383,EE855A723FE0,"First of all Hello, Ms. In my opinion I think that is better to work in group. I have 3 reasons that I would like to share with you my reasons are that everyone would like to share differents ideas, Also working in group we can finish more early, and we can socialized with different people. Now Im going to describe you why I choose this reasons. By sharing ideas I meant that everyone can have the opportunity to think and talk about that that person think. Because we dont have the sames ideas as other people thought. After all people in the group share their ideas we can writte in a piece of paper and see which ones are good and makes any sence, about the topic we are talking and we see which ones we can put on the class work we are going to do. Also about that we can finish more early, we can show it to the teacher on time and she can give as her opinion and ask her for some help about what part she think that we can add more especific words or meanings. Because sometimes we think that we have a good project but sometimes we have to figure out what part we can change and put differents things. And the last but not least that we socialized with others this one is my favorite because in this one I can discribe a little bit of my self when I just came to this country from another I was so shy because no one came to talk to me in my second day of school. In my English class my teacher make a groups and some people start talking with me 2 person from that class help me in my english because it wasnt that good. I was so scare because first everyone was looking to me like I had something in my face and in this country everything is different to my country in this one we need some friends that help us when we need some help in english. Them I introduce my self to everyone and I start making new friends. When we are new we think that no one is going to talk with us because we are from another country. Sometimes they dont talk with us because we dont speak the same lenguage as other. But we have to try our best to be friendly and make that the person doesnt feel shy we would like to that person feel happy in school and in each classes. Thas why I think that is good to be working in group not alone. When we have homework or projects we like to have some help then doing by our self that is more hard, the projects are always so difficult or sometimes you dont understand what the teacher said because we are seatting on the back and some students are talking and we couldt hear anything about what the teacher is talking about. But in a group they are 2 or more then 2 in the same group is good that one of that person of your group understand and explain to the people didnt get it. The internet is a big problem to alot of us some of us that we dont have internet or computer eather. I think that is a problem for me and one of the reasons that I like working in groups some family doesnt have enough money to put internet in home or buy a computer in home but also go to a public places that have internet and computer we have to pay. But working in group one of the students may have internet and go to that person home. I know that in our school we have computers in the library but on weekends is close the school or some of us we cant stay after school. Because we have to pick our littler brother or sister from other school. But the good thing is that one of us could have computer or internet in home and research some things about our work or project. Another thing that is good working in group is that when we are explaining a project in from in class we dont feel ready because we have to talk a lot or others reasons but in groups we can break parts and each one is going to talk about that part she or he loves more. My Final opinion that I would like to share is that working is group is a good option then working by our self. Because not all of us have the opotunity to have internet, not all of us speak english some of us we need that someone speak our language for example sometimes I need someone that help me with some words in english that I dont understand because my first language is spanish and its hard came to a country that dont speak your native language. And we can know new people to talk, not with the sameones because there is a lot of people that we dont talk and they are in the same classes of us we just want to be with the same ones and have to talk with everyone and help then when they need help.

Reason two Albert Einstein used his imagination to be really smart and creative. Also people who invented stuff they used their imagination and not only that they made millions just by using there imagination, and construction workers got to use there own imagination just to construct a big buildings and houses.

Some students say having long breaks gives them time to relax and not having to worry about school for a couple of weeks is a good thing. One day on my summer break me and my friends were discussing on how much we love our long summer breaks. We also realized that having a long summer break is only fair because we spend so many hours in school everyday. Summer breaks are better when they are shorter because, students dont forget as much information that they learned during school. Its better to come back and still remember the stuff you learned. Just imagine coming back after a 5 week break, I doubt students would be able to take a test right away. We need shorter breaks because if students spend to much time away from school theyll forget the important things theyve learned. Students should consider spending more time in school rather than spending all there time on their breaks. Spending more time in school is more important than spending longer weeks out of school not learning anything. Students must realize that their education is more important than spending time off of school. School teaches us what we need to know for the future, it prepares us for the next stage of life. They need to realize that they need to learn us much as they can, the more effort put into school work and learning the better the outcome. Life shows us that you cant just get a job without knowing anything, you cant sign up if you dont know your basic math or basic reading. Some students think school is a waste of time but honestly its preparing us for the stuff we need to know. Students do not retain information as easily when they return. Those long breaks really take a toll on the students, they return to school and dont have a clue on how to solve a basic problem. The more time students have out of school the more it drains their memory on what theyve learned. Coming back on an empty brain not knowing anything isnt good at all because what if a student had an exam on the day he or she returned, do you think theyd pass? Having a shorter break would improve a lot of things. In conclusion, itd be so much better if breaks were shorter than they usually are. Students would be able to come back and easily answer a question and get it right. The less time on break the better, school should be the main priority for students. Im sure that some of the students would love to pass their classes. Overall we know that having a shorter break would improve the learning skill for all students. I agree that our breaks should be shorter so we could stay on track and keep p our good work. ",8,9,8,10,10,10,184,"conventions 10, grammar 10, phraseology 10, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
40,2386,E96C123FAC95,"CHOOSE YOUR OWN CHARACTER The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote,""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? Take a position on this issue. Do we need to choose are own character traits yes, or no? In my opinion I will say yes we need choose our character because If we choose our character we can be wherever we want, good,or bad person, etc and we are going to do a good job if we choose our own character traits. First, If I choose my own character I will give my best work because I choose my own character, and Im going to feel very comfortable, and so happy to do it my character. For example, I remember one friend from my country his name were Generic_Name and he was doing a activity school was theater, and they were doing the story of Little Red Raiding Hod, and he was acting the wolf he was the bad gay, and he did a really good job I was so impressed, I remember he say in the stories I always Im going to be the bad guy because the bad guy is the second most important character, and is the conflict of the story the one who make interesting the story. Next, you can develop and demonstrate your skill acting, If you choose your own character because you are going to do a great work, and you are going act like you are a real actor and maybe you can discover acting, If have a passion of acting. For example, I hear some stories about actor. How they like acting, and they say in the first time they didnt liked to act but them there was starting like how they act, that how they like to acting because its fun to act, and you can enjoying acting with your friends. Finally, If I do one character I dont like, or I dont choose probably Im not going to give my best work because Im not going to feel comfortable or exacting to do it. For example, I remember like 3 years ago In my English 9 class we do a act about Romeo And Juliet and they give my the character of the guard and I was not exacting to do it, so I didnt do very well but I try I think If I try maybe I will like the character but I didnt liked that why I prefer to choose my own character. In conclusion, If you choose your own character you are going to do a good job and great work, you are going to demonstrate and develop your skill acting If you do the character you choose, and if you do a character you did choose you probable are not going to do a great job, or maybe you are not going care about the character this are the reason why is good to choose a character them someone give you a character. So remember choose your own character dont wait Intel someone give you a character,and dont forget is telling you the one who wrote the article. >_<",8,6,8,7,7,6,3394,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

42,2388,898A8417D70E,"Do you know that 80% of students that goes to the after school program and received more extra help succeeded more than the students who didnt go? After school program helps students that needs more help to succeed, pulls up students grades, and they will have extra time to complete missing work and home works. If a student wasnt available in a class and missed the class lesson;They would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers and learn what they missed and complete their missing work that they havent done in class. Students stay after to study with their friend and teacher for the test and receive help on difficult lessons by that grades will increase for students that will make them succeed in the future. And its a better way for teachers to explain the lesson without interrupting the class and make other students confused. Having you missing work done at school might be hard to do in classes but by having the after school program you will have the time to complete them with your teacher and your friends and taking more help by asking the teacher about what you dont understand. Sometimes some students needs more time completing the tests or the quizzes so the only way to complete them is staying after so they wont lose points and grades. On the other hand some students think that staying after is a waist of time and you wont receive any benefits, and some dont care if they have missing work or classes they missed ,but its all wrong staying after is a much better way for pulling grades up its a really big opportunity that teachers give their own time to their students by complete missing work, making the teacher explain the lesson again to the students to make them understand the lesson and what its talking about so they wont be confused or fail the class. In retrospect after schools programs is big good opportunity that most schools provide for students to receive that extra help from teachers to complete what their missing to make students succeed in school and pull up their grades thats why we should persuade students to go after school for help, thats why Im base with school programs.",8,6,7,8,7,8,1826,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

Sometimes I dont feel good to practice, because the food was not heath to my body or it wasnt enough. My team mates told me that they bring their own food because the lunch menu of the school do not like them, and they are tired to eat the same food every single day Some students have to go out to buy healthier food. Another reason why the lunch menu should be change is because an healthier lunch, keeps you awake and with energy. Some student need to eat health because they are in school teams. Also, sometimes you feel tired when you are studying. you feel that your stomach hurts and feel that something is wrong with your body, you feel sleepy, sometimes hungry, and you can not concentrate in the class. For example, I have Personal Fitness on my last period, when I eat my regular lunch menu, I feel tired and sometimes I dont want to do anything because I feel my body too heavy.

As long as the person doesnt give up and keep focus, then theres nothing to worry about. Staying on task isnt that hard, but if theres any distractions you must remove yourself from that situation and get back on track. Like imagine if a student was in class having trouble focusing because the students around them were distracting or noisy. Then they may ask the teacher that they prefer working in the hall because the noise in the class is to distracting to them. The key is when it comes to doing something you must keep busy to reach that goal of finishing or being done.

Some people sometimes decide to isolate because they cannot handle the pressure of this world being a human is not easy becasue sometimes you just feel that the comments that the people make about you are real, but everybody should be strong and be themselves,because we as humans we can do anything that we want to achieve our goals and never pay attention to those comments because we can show them who we really are. Firts, desire a lot of people when they see someone that is doing great on their life, sometimes people dont like it, others ones start thinking on doing it becuase they know the this man/woman are there because they work hard, in this world nothing is easy to have unless you work so hard to get it but never try to be soemeone else and is not necessary to do things that you dont like because you are trying to be like one else not do the mistake the most important thing is that you are going to show to those people that did not believe in you that nothing is impossible even when this world if full of envy. Second, confidence now people around the world what they see in a person is their appearance,clothes, shoes, etc, now people are like trying to be something that they are not to try to fit in this fake world, but you know there is where you realize that is wrong to be honest things dont matter what really matter is who you are you and what can you offer to this world that is trying to kick you out, but you start getting confidence and that is a big challenge to try be youse around people that dont see life the way you see it. Third, success as the world give you hard times you start to be strong, sometimes you have to go through things ` that you start to think about giving up, but you quickly think that you are wrong that you are going to make it even if is impossible like the author says ""To be you yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplsiments."" Some people have lose their confidence becuase they are trying to be something that theyre not, people think that being fake is the best way to fit, i dont think like them i think that you should you be who you really are. In a world where you have to fight to be yourself and dont get lost in the fantasy that the world offers you that is the greastest accomplisment. A lot of people might argue that is not true, but they are all wrong because people always can be themselve if they wants even is the world if full of lies is their responsability to make real their dreams.

Did you know that if you pick up trash out of your way or someone else way you can actually help them think about why did they not pick up trash. Act of kindness are everywhere from picking up trash to doing your brother or your sisters chores one day they will realize something about why you wash their dishes everyday. I think kindness is the most important personality of a human being why i think kindness is a important personality? You can change peoples mind or the way how they think about some stuff, for example if you can help someone to get across street when their is too much traffic you are doing a act of kindness, and you can help change other kids minds by making them think about their parents who is trying to cross the street trust me they will jump right in. One important thing about kindness is that you always need to have a positive set of mind that means that if someone is asking you for help jump right in and help him dont just answer ""I dont know"" if you actually dont know where the place is try asking someone else if they know about the place the other person is talking about. Some people take kindness in a negative way only some people and at a certain time some people like to do stuff on their own and sometimes they like their own time and own place and own work they dont any help from others like me sometimes I like to do stuff on my own, but sometimes I need someone to help me. I would like to help people in need for example; taking out someone else trash, helping my new neighbors settle in the community, and mow my new neighbors lawn. kindness can open many opportunities some people even think that kindness is a part of their religion and I really think it should be a part of every religion because it can really help you and people around you and you can change each others mind or opinion on one thing by kindness,all these thing just does not sound it is possible but it could be. To be honest I think that kindness is one of my superpowers if you ask me but sometimes its not but those times without kindness goes by quickly with kindness on your side you can become anyone you want and be a bigger person that everyone. In these days people who understand kindness they are actually showing kindness and they are also telling us to be kind to each other. I feel like kindness has become a big part of peoples life in 2019-2020 and i expect the same or more amount of kindness over generations and I also feel like that the person who really teaches us kindness in childhood is our parents.",7,7,6,8,7,6,1412,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
50,2396,E3097287CBD1,"Some school offer distances learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think student would not be benefit if they had distances learning. Many student would not focused during the lesson they would just do whatever they want so they wont learn as much as if they had a teacher. If student had online classes they would not get the attention necessary if they need help. Some student often have a bad day so they often dont pay attention and they just dont do the work that is assigned to them. they often just search the answer without learning but they think thats okay because no one is watching them. Many of them dont learn the subject but still somehow they passed the class. Other Important, reason why student wont benefit from online classes is that the may have some big problem in their life and they need someone to talk to but their one home so they feel sad, but if they were in school they can talk to a teacher,coach,counselor, or any other they feel happy to talk too. Other student may be sad they dont have someone to talk too. Online classes dont benefit students because they dont have the help they need. When student take online they can paid someone to do their work, and pretend that they did the work. One reason they can ask their brother to the work for them so they are not really learning anything. Other example, student may request some extra help but they wont get it because they dont a teacher with them. so they just dont understand but when it comes to do the text they failed. Other example might be that they are having family problem so they wont do the online classes. And they would not be focus. Having online classes wont help student in their life. one example is that they wont have friends and when they go to the real world they are going to have trouble talking to people because they dont know how too. Other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. Most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they dont have the opportunity to chat with them. When students get video conferencing they dont really understand because something the video dont really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . School should not have video conferencing. Student are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes.. one reason they going to feel bad is that they did not enjoy high school life. lets Image if a student was really good at soccer or any other sport and if they had played high school they could of get a scholarship, and maybe become one of greatest, but they didit because they were talking online classes. school should not have online classes because it take the right of student in playing high school sport. Overall, student would not benefit from online classes. they wont learn that much at home, and student need the attention to do work, they also need people to help them with their work.

Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school thats a lot of benefit for people that dont work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school. Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason. Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you thats helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home. Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they dont have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work. Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the dont have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they dont have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online thats going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .",5,5,5,4,5,5,2017,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

53,2399,B0D627CB7309,"The American jazz legend Duke Ellington said ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" I believe that the meaning that this quote was trying to convey is that when we are faced with a problem it does not matter how challenging that problem is we must use it as a chance try our best. Sometimes a lot of things can happen unexpectedly but we must believe in ourselves that a problem could be an opportunity to try our best, it might also prepare us for bigger problems in the future. Although sometimes we might experience difficulties while trying to solve that problem in our lives we just have to keep on giving it our best to overcome it. When we are faced with a problem it does not matter how challenging the problem is we must use it as a chance to try our best. Completing a group project, homework, or writing an essay are one of the few examples that can represent how sometimes it doesnt matter how big the problem is we must try our best. Finishing a group project, homework might seem as though it would be something that could be completed without difficulty it does take a bit of an effort for some people. However these people keep on trying because they want a good grade or dont want to fail class. This might apply to people that are still in school but being responsible and completing all of this work might prepare them for their future careers. Sometimes a lot of things can happen unexpectedly but we must believe in ourselves that a problem could be an opportunity to try our best, it might also prepare us for bigger problems in the future. For example athletes, athletes sometimes sustain injuries while playing and have to recover. These injuries are not easy to recover from as it could damage a part of their body that could possibly prevent them from playing for some time. To overcome these problem athletes train a lot and use it as an opportunity to train and rest more to be in a good condition before finally playing with the rest of their team. These shows how sometimes you have to take advantage of something an use it as something to try your best on. Although sometimes we might experience difficulties while trying to solve that problem in our lives we just have to keep on giving it our best to overcome it. Occasionally we encounter difficulties while trying to find the solution to a problem in our lives an example of this could be having to give a speech in front of a large audience. Some people t dont like speaking in front of a large group of people this can be a problem in their lives. These people have to be able to control their nervousness, something that could be hard to control. These people try hard to overcome a problem that is stopping them from doing certain things. All of this examples represent how sometimes were faced with problems that can be difficult to let go off. I think that the meaning of the quote is something important as it can apply to certain situations that are rather difficult. This quote shows us how sometimes there a certain problems in our lives that can be very difficult but we should try hard and do our best. I believe that there a lot of problems that we can learn from because sometimes while trying to solve those problems we make mistakes and we can learn form those mistakes and move on.

First impression is something no one can forget it can be attitude, love, feel but with all this impression we can not forget or change even we went to it will not be the same to impress someone with an ex we are attitude they ways we talk, walk even eat no one can change and someone try to impress his love to a girl he has be in love since children even someone come out of no where he will not be able to change the first impression of this person. When we make the first impression to people even we know they will try to copied or change it will be impossible because everyone know the impression it is not something that we can change even we change it is not going be the same an example Generic_Name tried to impression Generic_Name with her food Generic_Name love it and went to make the same food it will be the same but it will not taste the same way because he dont known what kind of ingredient she put in and even she tell him it will not going taste the same so every first impression can not be change. We known what it is a first impression are almost impossible to change because it kind like feeling no one can change because impression is something we do to impress people with what we have sometime is not even real or fake but some time we think it real, Generic_Name lied about her personality and family to try to impression hers friends in school they will believe her so impression can be sometime a lie but impossible to change.

Most of the people does not have their goals done because they are not positive. a positive attitude is the key to success in life because they has positivism,life challenge,and people are secure of them self. First,A positive attitude is the key to success in life because they has positivism. For example, Generic_Name is a person who always think positive in his life,school,and his work. that is why he is not afraid for any challenge in his life. Another example, Generic_Name is always positive in her life because she complete every challenge with positivism, and she works hard to success in her goals.

56,2402,AA9B263544A9,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? In my opinion, I dont think the students would benefit taking classes at the comfort of their homes. That is because its not the same thing as going to school. Taking classes at home is not the same as taking classes in school because in school you have a teacher that can help you, if you dont understand whats going on in the class. Also another reason is that in school you have a teacher that can teach the student actual lessons that the student can benefit from. Third reason is because sometimes you will just be lazy and not do the work and just do whatever you want since youre at home. No one will stop you, or give you remainders to do your work. Overall, I dont think the students would benefit from taking classes at their homes. I would think that online classes would be harder and difficult to understand. In fact, being in a normal class you learn more and you are all catched up with your work. Being in school will help you communicate more with others, you can make or meet some new friends,the teacher will help you with some work if you need it. Online classes are harder because the student might not know what to do and he/she will be lost. Some people might find that online classes are hard and some might not it just depends on the individual. Some people just learn differently. In conclusion everyone is different. What might work for you, might not work for the next person. Some people might benefit from talking online and some might not it. Honestly it just depends on what the students perfers online classes or school classes. I think that taking class in school is way better, teachers help you, you get better knowledge, you communicate more with others.

Also success is not something easy to get, but without loss calm could get it with enthusiasm. Success has an role important in the life of many people since it is something that is necessary in their academic level, their jobs, and their goals to have a better future. First, success is difficult to get at the academic level, but the students need know that although they are failing with effort they could get it. Since to get it, they need to study a lot without loss the hope of getting success. Also they need to practice each step to do more easy their activities and have a better success. For example: if students loss any test they need to study and practice a lot to get their success with enthusiam. For this reason, the importance of the success also depend of failure to failure to learn. Second, in the work, the success depend of many dedication and is absolutely necessary working a lot to get it. If the employees is not working well, the problem could be that the company not could have success and the employees could be exonerated of their jobs. Moreover, if they are exonerated their jobs, they need to looking for another jobs without loss the calm to get their new jobs with a great enthusiasm. For example: An employee was farawell for does not a good report, but continuous practicing and learned to do a good report after that the employee found a good job did a very nice job. Sometimes the success in the work is not easy to get, but neither impossible. Finally, the people have many goals in their future, but also have obstacles to get success. The goals are difficul to accomplish, but not difficult to do. Furthermore, to realize their goals, they need to keep completely firm their ideas to find the success. Sometimes, they can failure, but they have the capacity to do anything and accomplishment their success for example, A family want to go to the beach, the problem is that they do not loss money to their vactions, yet they were to the beach because winning money working hard and with a great emotion they arrived to the beach. All goals can get with dedication and effort. In conclusion, from failure to failure, the success can be possible and get it with a great enthusiasm. In the academic level, job and goals for future there are not impossible to accomplish the success.

Online classes are helpful for students because they may have jobs to go to and they dont have time to attend so they can take online courses.

The confidence brought him to USA and had the opportunity to get a high pay job. In conclusion I strongly believe students shouldnt be praise.

First of all, Let say that you dont really see your family that often, You can take them to the park when they come to your house so you all can spend time together as a family that you dont really see. You can talk to your brothers if you dont see him him or her that often you can take him or her to the park ride around with bikes, Maybe go for a run to burn some calories down so you can stay healthy and in a good shape. And if you have a problem with someone in your family the park is the best way yo go and talk it out, Why because you can smell that fresh and clean air from the outside world you have time to think what you really want to do and talk to your self, If your a religious person that likes talking to god Im telling you go to the park you can talk to him you get everything of your head and you dont think stupid stuffs, Because some people when they are mad or they are sad they just go on their room and lock them self in their room thats not good because you are not breathing clean air like the outside world and the firs things teenagers do is yeah I am a bad boy I am going to smoke with my friends, I ask you this what benefits do you get from doing that? The park is the best way to go and take your stress out and clear your mind. Second If your an athletic and you dont have money to go to the gym or you dont have time, Dont worry about that I have one way for you to stay healthy and on shape by going to the park look there is so much stuffs you can do at the park you can go for a run, push-ups, curl-ups you can Stretch your body, And the good thing is that you are not breathing that air from the Gym and at the park you are breathing clean and fresh air. The best thing is that it is totally free and you can take anyone you want to take and you can see more people there that you dont know you can make more and new friends. Another reason is that If the house you leave in is to small to make a party, Guess what I have the correct spot for you the park you can play music you can make a big party invite us much as people you want to invite.

And in the summer they make a little fair and let me tell you man It is amazing, You can try different types of food because people come and sell food and It doesnt cost that much you can smell the delicious food.

In my opinion, I believe that most students that take online classes have a higher risk of failing. Therefore, they have a higher change of getting distracted. Studies confirmed that young adults are more likely to get distracted than adults since, their minds are not fully develop. I also believe that, every human being has a different way of learning and goes on their own pace. There is positives and negaitives reasons about person-to-person learning and online learning. Person-to-Person learning helps the students gain more knowledge and interaction. While being in a traditional classes, you can ask questions anytime and gain a relationship with one another. The negaitives of tradtional learning is that, students attend to skip class, not listen to the teacher, and sleep during teaching. Students attend to do these negative actions because they might be force to go to school or they can not go on their own pace. Online classes are not benefical but you can go on your own pace. Another reason is that, techonolgy is popular in this generation that students rather be in a device. Online classes have a positive side to them because there is many options online in what you want to learn about, but keep in mind that visual is harder than interacting. Visual is diffcult to understand because there is no instuctor or a teacher helping you in person. I believe that everybody is different and we all learn in different ways and different pace. Some Students would not be able to attend at home classes because of personal problems such as, not having food to feed themselves, some do not have a roof over their heads, or they do not have access to a device. For an example, there are some students at Generic_School that do not have food at their home and all they eat is school lunch. It hurts to see Children that are not able to afford things in life that are in need such as, education. Education is in all of our lifes and I hope traditional schools can still be popular as online schools. In this generation techonology is taking over students!. In conclusion, I support my reasons and my opinions about, traditional learning is a better way to learn than online learning. They both have Pros and Cons but Traditional learning has been in our lives for so many years and techonology and devices are taking over students. Distraction is what young adults have trouble with, Online classes is not a great idea to pursued. There are many reasons and studies, why students should keep attending traditional schools.

69,2415,C85DA87E87CC,"Dear Teacher, Ive been asked if is more beneficial working in a group with students or working alone. In my opinion I think working as a group is more beneficial than doing all the work alone. I think working as a group is less stress on the student but helps get the work done faster and easier. Ive noticed that people do better in group projects because the work can be split between the students and not just one person doing all the work that may be hard to understand or do all the work on time. Working as a groups helps mostly those students who really dont do their work on time or having problems in understanding what to do and also they can ask the students in the group for more support or in explaining something more clear. For example, if a student that is working alone doesnt understand the concept of the project and has no one to ask or just doesnt want to ask the teacher they will either do it wrong or just not do it because they dont have that extra support. In a group you usually have that person that is on top of you if you are doing you part and asking if you need help or need more explaination. Being a group creates communication skill and helps those who have trouble with interacting with other students. Working as a group get the work done faster and helps not go to hard on youself. This is why when a teacher asks me if I want to work alone or with a group or partner, I always work with someone else becasue it just helps me get my assighnment done on time because I have done big projects by myself and I see that I struggle do it , then at the end I get a bad grade or I just end up not doing it because I feel like I can ask th teacher for help. Some students have this problem in reaching out to their teacher because they are either shy or they just cant find a way to get their help. Many students will agree that working as a group is helpful and beneficial instead of working alone where is hard to do everything alone and having to plan what to do to get an assignment done and hoping for the best.

71,2417,80EF60E3EA04,"One school activity that kids enjoy are field trips because it provides them a brake from school work and it gives them a opportunity to explore their surroundings. Teachers and students often get tired of being at one place everyday. Students are also constantly working and the only break they have is lunch and electives. The teachers also get brakes but they have their phones on them all day. Teachers and staff may feel stressed planing the trips but in the end i think they enjoy it just as much as the students. Middle school is a stressful time. Students have to complete lots of work that isnt needed. They also have packets of homework to complete and the packets are usually due the next day. Teachers just hand out papers and papers of homework without thinking about it. meanwhile, students are trying to study for important stuff like tests,sols or exams. I try to complete all the work i have but it is hard when all the teachers are saying,my work is more important. We are constantly reviewing, working or studying and sometimes its just too much. This is why we want to go on field trips or go outside more often. Schools are not the most funnest place to be. Many schools, like Generic_School, are extremely stuffy and dirty. Being in a building thats stuffy all day makes many people annoyed. Everyday students asks to go outside. However, the teachers and staff always say no because the administrators wont allow it. My school has a outside siting area in the middle of the school but nobody gets to sit outside. Students often look forward to the end of the day or field trips because it gives them air and a chance to breath. Being outside or in a new location gives students the chance to get to know their surroundings. however, being controlled and forced to stay in one place makes them feel like prisoners. This is why students love field trips and new outdoor places. In conclusion, the most enjoyed activity in schools are field trips because it gives them a breather and it gives them the opportunity to explore. Students and teachers should not have to be in a place like prison. I think there should be more field trips not just two a year.

Unless you you try something beyond what you have already mastered. you will never grow. The author want to let the people know that theres many way to grow up. The people should think about to do different stuff even if they are mastered in any profession. Does Mr. Emerson thought about the people when he wrote his message in his text. Yes he does. He thought a bout it because he clearly is talking to the people in his writing. People shouldnt stop learning other stuff or do other kinds of work because they are professional in one job. I agree with Mr. Emerson about his writing. Many people in society just want to focus in one thing. but that affect the development of the community of work. Also if you never try something new you will never know. and if you do not try you are closing you mind and the opportunity to learn. The people should think about to grow up.

74,2420,57B782277D2F,"Think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone and what do you feel is more beneficial? I think that working with a group is more beneficial because you can get things done quicker, share creative ideas, and it shows teamwork. It also saves up time when working in a group and when having deadlines. First, working with a group gets things done quicker and you dont have to worry about much things when working with a group. When you have a group, they could be doing something else while you do another thing at the same time. However, having to do all that stuff by yourself slows you down and might not have time to finish. Your group and you are all doing something and that makes everything go quicker because your not doing it all by yourself. If you work alone you could be stressed and have to think of all the ideas. Working in a group can really bring more ideas to the stuff you and your group are working on. Also, you can divide the work with your group members and make things faster. Second, sharing the ideas with your group can be helpful. It can also be very fun working with other people and having different opinions around. Someone in your group can be the most creative person and really help out on what you are working on. If you dont share your ideas then whats the point of being in the group. Everyone needs to have something to say and something to work on. If you work alone you will miss the opportunity to have someone helping you and have an opinion on it because when you present it, other people might something to say about it. Working alone can be frustrating and exhausting for some people because when they dont know something on one will be there to help them. Also, having to work alone might make you to multitask a lot and difficult for you to finish on what you are doing. Last, shows teamwork and that teamwork makes everything better than having to work alone. When you show teamwork with your group it shows that all of you can be leaders in that group. Working in a group can be really fun because you be partnered up and meet new people or be with the same people you know and make the work effort exciting. When being in a group, you can your part while everyone else does theirs and it makes everything go quicker. In conclusion, I would prefer working with a group than working alone because working with a group make things much easier and less work too. I wouldnt want to work alone because I wouldnt have anyone to discuss and share my opinions with. Having to do all that work by yourself can be very difficult in the process; things may not come out the way it should. Also, when you work alone you might not have many ideas to think of and with a group you can. Working by yourself may not be as much fun as in a group. If you had a group you would be able to divide the work, but working on something by yourself probably make it two times harder. Thats why I think that working in a group is more beneficial than working all alone.",9,8,8,8,8,8,1130,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

I get that people use technology because of their jobs, but for other people is a distraction. Im not saying its a bad to have technology, what im saying is that now people dont hangout like they used to, they dont go shopping anymore now, they only want to be at home this is why, I considered a negative effect to peoples lives. Now almost teenagers, dont hangout with their friends anymore because they just can face time or call them without going out of their house. If they do hangout they are only on their cellular devices and not socializing; thats mean to the person that they are hanging out. They are only worried about their social media for example, they only see how many likes, comments and followers they get. Also, about what people say about them in social media and if they get tag in a picture. This is how people is now, they dont see the importance of talking to each other, they only want to know about what people say about them in social media. People now does not want to go shopping stores anymore, which this means that stores are closing because of people buying everything online. So buying everything on online is the new thing on technology, therefore people now doesnt need to go out to buy what they need, now people just can order it thats why, they are being more lazy. For example, if they want pizza they just order it online or they saw a cute dress, but they didnt wanted to go to the store and buy it, they just order it online. And they get it to their house, so they dont go all the way there. In this generation, almost everyone stays at home because they just want to be alone watching Netflix or being in their cellular device. Back then, people always went outside and play with their friends in the streets. It was fun to play with other people, people enjoyed it. Sometimes they even got the chance to meet more people. Now, if they want to be play with other people, they just download a game on their cell phones, computer or even on social media; now they have games too. Also, people used to go watch a movie or hangout at least, but now people stay at home because they can see the movies or playing videogames with other people online. In conclusion, people dont hangout like they used to, they dont go shopping anymore, now they only want to be at home. Technology had people changed a lot during this generation. But, what i have seen technology is a negative effect on peoples life. This why its not a good thing of having technology, because is keeping people away from the other people.

I personally think that my talent is photographing, but photographing take skills as well. Taking pictures is relaxing, fun, and cool at the same time. Photographing is I guess not easy and hard because while taking pictures you have to find the right angle the your photo and as well you can just take your picture in your own way. How I developed photographing is by going out and looking at intense images. when I go out, I always think about if I should take some photos of whats there like: the River People, and maybe other Cities as well as Nature. While taking pictures, its really relaxing because you can feel the wind breeze on your face and you can release your stress. For me I think that its fun because you can take pictures whatever you want, I also think that taking pictures is cool because you can see how things looks like up close how it looks like on camera. How I use it is by releasing everything that is on my mind. I also use it for improving my skills as well. For me sometimes its a little bit hard because I need to find the right angle for the photo Im taking. My photograph skills arent that good, but I practice everyday so I could take better images. During my free time I go out and find some photographic things like: Insects, the Moon, and other objects, and take pictures of them. To conclude , in my opinion I think that photographing can be your talent and your skill as well because if you like looking at intense images then you can take an intense picture too, or you can take it just for fun.

78,2424,5D843D1CD37D,"I agree because maybe it could lead to new friendships or relate able things or a thing with a teacher. For example I had to do an assignment similar to this and I told them all of my most productive activates I could think of and almost everyone was similar to my activities like they do the same activities as I do too. Youll never know if you meet new people that youve never seen before or heard before and they turn nice and you guys could be good friends. I had friends from my soccer team and they were in my school that I didnt even knew that they were in my school so I started to hang out with them in school and after soccer practice. Its basically about friendship because if someone wants to meet more and new people they should go try out something they like and try it out with their future friends and enjoy together. For example, I keep meeting more and more people because of after school activities or someone in school that is friends with their friends.

Sometimes your parents might force you do to some activities at school or outside of school its because they want you to feel like youve like accomplished everything in life and youve decided to try something new for once and will actually enjoy it and stick to it as long as you live or until you quit or retire.

81,2427,2D508127DEF1,"There is a debate today day about whether the students should study from home or school. Many people agree that the appropriate way to study is going personal to the school. My idea is that they are well understanding when the students go to the school because they have mutiple attention. Here are some reasons why many students master a course in school rather than online courses. First they can ask questions at any time, second improvement on learning new topics, and last friends support in group work. First, many teenagers who take online courses still have questions or guesses on their answers. Here some reasons why many on the students does not master some courses. The classes related with Math, Chemistry, and History are the complicated for most learners. Those who are assisted by a teacher are the ones with the chance of clarify any problem related with numerical or logic problem; also the teenagers can make corrections in their work by asking for solutions. While the students with online courses are involved with more guesses, but the course program does not provide clear answer or does not provide an answer. Second, the improvements in schools classes vary depending the faculty member you are with. Online games made by the teachers related with the actual topic makes the topic easy by practicing in the game, also entertain them at the same time keeping their minds relaxed and widely open to process more information within the game. Other teachers prefer individual activities with certain amount of exercises provided in previous classes. Those improvements help to find new ways to solve a problem, hints, and interpretation of the problems. The online courses does not provide incentives for students allowing them to decrease the interest in the process. Finally, friends. They provide self confidence by asking an unclear problem and having different points of view at the same time. The opinions provided for the people you know encourage them to keep it up; theres some times the teacher explanations does not clarify at all and your group provides detailed explanations of a process. The efficiency in the group is enforced by dividing the labor and finishing soon; them the work can be shared with the people at the table, explaining how the process was made, and at the same time they can make corrections in what the other person have done. Different than the online practice made by the person self can take weight longer to get an specific difficulty. Those are the reasons why many people prefer the schools rather than house. The help in questions by the teachers, improvement in learning in different ways, and the support of people you know and you feel confident with. Those reasons allow students to be better at something they arent with the help of someone that knows more about the course.

82,2428,9B5E878ED861,"Everyone would like to receive praise for their work, even if the work is not their best effort, that will make them not to think low of themselves and just give up. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence. Although, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didnt achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement. I think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination. For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time. In addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I dont do better because I dont have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. He praised me and courage me to do better. That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice. According to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student. To all the teachers, please praise a student work and let the student feel like the can do more and better.

They are able to make their on decision but i dont think that it has to be required to take a class that some people arent interested in. I am disagree with this prompt because those classes should an elective. In my opion i wouldnt take any of those classes and my reason why is because i am not going to enjoy or like the class because i am not interesting in it and theres not a required that i have to take any of those classes. I had a friend who didnt want to come to his art class. One day i asked him why dont you go to that class and he was like i dont like the class, i dont enjoy it at all and also i didnt choice it, they just put it in my schechule. i was like look you should go to the office and talk to them about it. Because you dont want to be there and also you dont even come to that class and after a few days and he went to talk to his consul about it. Less than a week he always be in his class and i was like its your own choice to make desicion but i resolve it be cause you helped me. But in other school i have one friend that he loves his art class and now hes taking it almost every year and he told me. Generic_Name you should take an art class because its really cool and you do a lot of art also i enjoy it and i really like the class but i dont know what do you like but in my perpective i would take an art class every year. I told him look i am not going to take a class that i dont like because id rather be in a class that i like and i would enjoy it and i want to do stuff that i like and it will be my choice if i enjoy or not a class. Because look theres a lot of option and you can make a decicion and he told me "" Yeah you right"" and by it i just tell them everybody have to make their own decion but also remember that every decion have a concecuense. I asked a lot of people what would you do if they put you in a classs that you dont want to be in it?. They told me i just going to talk in the ofice so they can change it and i would love to come to that class but i also have the right to say something about if i dont like or i do like something cause we have a right to speak up. We should be able to choice what we want to study we dont have to have a requiered to do things we could do things by our own. But there might be a thing that make people think we should have a required to take classes that we dont want but also they have to think about that we are teenager and we might have our future planed but if they dont know that they have to take some classes they dont even want to take then those type of things make people think thats why we have to take classes to prove ourself. Another things and it influence a lot that they make required to do things and students just dont want to they have to think how we feel about things and how we would react. We all know that sometimes we are not in a mood or we are in our feeling or we just dont feel the day at all and it can affect our decion and required because people who make the required they just dont care about how would you feel or anything they just chose what they want and they say what they think will be better for a lot of students but the thing they dont think about it how would react to thing like i said earlier every decion has a consecuense and it could be good or bad but we have to deal with it. Most of the students would like to have all classes how they want and when they cannot do something they want then theres when the things starting coming out. Becuase they dont like it their behavior chnage and everything in that class. So all studesnts should be able to have the right to change things and everything in their schedule but their consul should have the right to say no to things that are not important at all and they could say you are taking this class because of this reason and you cant do it. Of course they will say something but they are taking care of their future and things they would do in life by taking any of this three classes. It might be good thing or it could be a bad thing but we just have to lisent to our students. Everyone have a right to make their own desion about classes and others things but if theres a required we are not able to do anythig. Because we just have to respect the rules and do it without our opinion. If we are able to make a choice then our feeling and the way we would feel about classes it will be matter and we could make our decicion and we will like the thing we choose. But sometimes we just cannot make the decision and someone else would chose it for us so we just have to see the pro and con about the desicion we would make or the thing we would do without thinking. I think it shouldnt be a required to take this classes and it would be a elective class because some people wouldnt take this type of classes they are not going to enjoy it and go because they just dont like it at all and everyone have the desicion to speak up and make decision by our own.",6,6,6,6,6,7,50,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

In the articule, I will argue that this program is a great opportunity to finish High School and start college early, But has to take some courses on summer school or evenings or if not are able to graduate in 3 year. Student can finish early High School. Student could start early college. Student can start to work. Student has the opportunty to finish High School and start to think in a new career in college. Student who graduate early has a opportunity to find a job and help to their family. I never can do it to graduate me early beacuse i made some crazy thing in my past that i can go back and make a correction, but this a good opportunity for all of them that can graduate early on High School. Should student be able to graduate High School in 3 year early? Some say that is not good to graduate in 4 year, but i say is better graduate in 3 year early as i coudnt do it at this time is too late to make me a correction on my life. In the future, i would like to my sons finish High School early if they can, to they have a better future than i was they will be better than me and never give up to find their future. In conclusion, students are able to finish High School early with complete all their requirement courses, then is better to graduate 3 year early at High School and i will let my sons know that make their effort and dont make my mistake to make then a better than i am.

88,2434,4F75DF4CEBE9,"This topic brings in a lot of question and concerns like Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it?. What are you suppose to think of when this question gets asked from you, well people dont really have a an answers for you,So i think that people get controlled by each other because of power. Some people think they got it all cause they have control over certain things then most people dontt have and they take advantage of them so they think its right for them to do what they can or cannot do to them. People dont need other people to show them how to belong or what they need in there life its not fair for others to pick what they want to do. People want what other people have to fit in or to roll along with them,But other people dont like that feelings cause they think they look cool, new cloths, new shoes, new bags etc they get it all and dont get me wrong people go for that some just dont. You only get to create your own self but you choose to follow others because thats the new trend and you want to fit in with what they offer to you its like a shiny new toy you can resist because then you wont be like other people. Influences are what catches people attention they want to persuade you into something or speak to you in matter that you dont even realize in till later. They get to change you because they know how to do it they speak in way they just gets your attention and you fall for it and next thing you know you want to be like them,talk like them,eat where they go, where they visit and who they are friends with. Those people what to see what they can get from you and how beyond you can take things people crave the attention they want what other people have,So they try to much to become them and they dont even realize in till it to late and not wanna go back. I get the point why they all do that to show how much things get done,how you want it,what needs to be done or what needs to happen. People go to their influences to hear what they already know but they dont want to be alone about it cause then people wont find them to cool to hang with. Most people think they need it to survive because they never really let themselves answer for them and they dont do anything about its like a drug to them they cant resist of it. You are your own person you just dont know how to be yourself or you think they wont approve of you,So now you probably think if you do what other people do and act like them you will think your getting notice by other people that makes you feel good and you continue to do so. So you lost yourself and cant even recognize yourself because you went to far now you cant even choices what you wanna do because people expect that from you now you let them choice your own life. They have power you dont control yourself they do you let people get the best from you and you let them have it because you didnt want to be weird and now things you aint always easy so now you gotta live with it. Trying to impress someone isnt you,its just wrong influences make you do anything you pick from good or bad and it goes one way you decide if you want that for you not what other people think and how they can get to you so quick that you do it and it all goes down hill from there. Make your future about what you think is best for you and only you stop making it what you what other people to view you as do you. Influences may get you places but are they the right ones though or is it something i just want you to hear. Making the right choice is great you decide what your gonna do,how your gonna live your life,and be yourself,But choice tp make the wrong choice and now people control you they get to what they want because they went for it and you cant get it back any more. People like to make a little stop for themselves inside your head so they can persuade you into anything and get what they want so they do by telling you this is the greatest thing every its the most amazing thing i did. Dont be fooled by that its all in your head you want to fit in i get it but dont take it to far where even your own close people tell you that you have change .So many things are gonna be asked from you and not even you will know how to answer because you let other people control you and talk for you that it became a things that you cant even get out of. Its better if you just stay in your lane and go for the good influences and not the bad type you create your own story not other people. Wrong to right is always the choice being a good influence is great you teach people the right way not the bad type. So many people choose bad and not good they want to fit in so bad thats its going bad for them picking the good is always right. You dont need to impress people when you got yourself and no shame for you just do what is asked and make a great thing happen. Right chooses bring you more things in life then bad getting good people in your life is always the answer a good influence can get you to a lot of things in life and you wont even notice in till it has happened. A chance to pick a good life then a bad one ill take it bad influences bring you no where its a joke if you pick the wrong influence make a good pick. So yes creating your own life is better and deciding on good influence then to have a life that will bring hell on you, yes i will always do so. Good infleuence is always the answer not things wrong about that and will always be my choice for you be the right infleunce that other need to hear from you speak up do whats right for you and yourself make a better you and let other people hear you speak you bring goood things into others peoples life not just yours.

Nothing of that is good so when a good freind comes to tell you advise they tell you good things. Another thing is that maybe somone could be lieng to you about somthing. and some people try to help but somtimes they make it worst by givving you bad edives. Like I said earlier somone might be lieng to you like for example he/she might say leave the house because your parents cause the problem. So you have to dectect that or els e you will get in seriuos problems. so i f you know that their is a fake freind trying to tell you lies say ok and leave. Another thing i said is that they probably give you the best edvise. What i mean about that is that they try to help you but they only make it worst like for example: your bf (boyfreind) breakes up with you and you cry for hours and he says ask him to be your bf again you will be ambaresed in front of everyone the last point i wanted to talk about is that more than one person is good to give you advise because some of them can not be halpfull some of them can be liars and some of them can be fake edvise,7,5,6,6,6,4,70,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

I think police one is correct because not only the students sometimes need to call their parents to come to pick then up or pick up early or come bring their lunch, but also because is impossible to make everyone obey Policy number 2, even if is a school policy most people will ignore it, so I think Policy number 1 is harder to be ignored. And even if we have a Policy against cell phones students would ignore it if is at lunch time because nobody is there to tell them not to use it, and the school already have to much to pay so the school would not pay someone to look at those students who are using cell phones during lunch. I think sometimes phones are problem while using during class, but if is in lunch or free time I dont see much problem, because you are not being rude, or interrupting anyone. So I think that sometimes phones are useful at school. If we put policy number 2 at school it wouldnt make any bad things but students would still not following it, and lots of students would have their phone taken away or get in trouble because of their phones uses at school during lunch time or free time.

91,2437,76C2E20AF20E,"When you were in high school would you have commit the career you have now? Many people do know what they want to do for their career, but others do not. In my opinion committing to a career at a young age is not a good idea. There are many people that choose a career at a young age, and now years later, they are not happy or they get bored. A lot of high school students do not know what they want to have as their career. It is also a lot of pressure for students to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives. When students go to high school , some of them want do explore different class to figure out what exactly, they want to do as their career. For example , I am in the 11th grade, and I still have not committed to a career. In the last 2 years, I was able to see what I might want to commit to and ones I do not have interest in. Some might say they want to be a doctor, lawyer, or even a teacher. But many might not go for that career in the future . Maybe it is because they found a different career that they love but figured it out at a different age. I see some people that are over 30, and are not happy with the career they committed to at a young age. They do not like going to work as much. Also when they committed to a career, they could have through it was totally different . But when they started to study for that career ,it was a little to late because they committed to it. When I am older , I want to be at least a little happy with what I have my career as. In the other sides opinion, I do see why committing to a career at a young age is pretty important too. It is better to have students study what career they want to commit to , so they can start to studying for it . Then they can start to expand their career at a young age. If I knew what career exactly I wanted to commit , I would have been taking classes for that specific career in high school. It always good to know what you want to study for at a young age, so you do not have to worry about it in the future. Students still not knowing what to commit to and having to commit to a career that the students might not like in the future are my two main supports to my opinion. I choose these two, because I think it supports my opinion the best. Students can always figure out what career they want in college , they do not have to know right away . Its a big part of a students life to commit to some thing they are going to be doing as their career. But it is always a pretty good idea to know what career you want to do at a young age.

92,2438,3D29C845934D,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to succeed in life. I strongly agree with this statement. Having a positive attitude, will make you be more successful in life. By having a good attitude can make a big difference. Always have faith in yourself. For example, if you have a test and you have a negative thought about something, dont automatically think youre going to fail, look over your test and check for any mistakes you might have made. Then when you are done checking over the test and feel better about it, then you should tell yourself you are going to pass it. Having a positive attitude can change your life completely. It is always important to have faith in yourself. You got this! The next thing is when you are out in public, it is always important to give a good and happy attitude to the people you see. Even if you dont know them, it can make anyones days. It can makes you a better person just by smiling at a person. You never know if that person is having a bad day and just by giving them a smile and a few words, it can make their day better. Another thing is if you are a teacher or parents and youre having a rough day due to a personal or medical problem, still try to give the kids a possible attitude. They look up to you and care about you. They dont deserve to be yelled at over the smallest things that wasnt even their fault. Having a negative attitude towards the students or your children is not a good thing. You might hurt their feelings or even worst think that they are not good enough for you. You are not being very successful if you keep on yelling at innocent children or even your own kids. In conclusion, Having a possible attitude is the key to success in life because it can make you a better person and give you a lot of self confidence. So If you ever feel unsure about something, look over and think what feels right to you. Also if you see a strangers, kids, etc, smile. It can make anyones day just by seeing that one smile.

93,2439,8060FCE12001,"Should students enjoy less summer vacation and more winter break. Why would they change the vacation time? Cant it just stay the same as usual? Would the students like like that change? Are those changes going to help the students in their studies? First of all some students wont like this change because,in the winter time it can get really cold ,so the students wont be able to go outside,walk,nor play. Also one of the reasons they wouldnt like the change is that i summer break they can be outside and go out places. In the winter could get really cold and the students stay outside for a long period of time they might get a could and miss some school days and affect them. If they miss schools days they will be behind from the class. In the other hand some students might like that idea because in the summer time it can get really hot outside .If its really hot outside people can get dehydrate ,but for other reasons summer days can be some amazing days. Some benefits of summer : going to the beach,amusement park,camping,and travel. Reasons that students will like to have more summer vacation:more vacations days,nice weather to go outside, go to the pool,explore nature and helps them to stop using technology. If this change in vacations happen I wont like it,because I like being outside in warm weathers and i woulld hate to have less summer break and more winter break .Plus I hate when we dont have school when theres a snow s day. I like how the vacation time is right now because everyone can enjoy some vaction in the tie that the like the best . I am aslo sure that most of the student will like to keep the same time of vacations beacuse they want to have more not less In conclusion the time of vacation will not change because the students will prefer to keep the same one .They will like to enjjoy the time not hate it. My point is if the studdent dont like the new time they will problobly wont like to g back to school and just ingnore it. So if they want to change the time talk to the student if they are ok with it ,if not then make a solution about it.

95,2441,2B66CE2870AD,"John Lubbock is a British naturalist and politician that wrote a quote saying ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make"". When saying this you have some opinions about it because your past can also make up your character and who you might become later on in the future. Why should we let your character take control of us, we have most of the control by the actions we take in our life. For example your parents were very abusive, and somehow your going to be that way to no its going to make you stronger and built your character up more then it was before. We have a choice to make up our character like some people will say ""oh shes mean, or ""why wont she share and its not her character maybe its her personality. You yourself built up your character and no one has to like it it but only you because at the end of the day all you have is yourself nobody else which is better then having someone judge you. No one can judge a book by its cover until they get to know who you really are and where you came from,your character can built you up and leave a legacy behind and you wont even know it because people will be proud of how you built your character up and ask ""how is she so strong ?"", ""how did she grow up to be independent?"". Once you tell them how strong you are and how your doing and the steps you took theyll be proud of you, because only you have control of how you can find your character traits. No one can really know for sure what makes up their chachater just by saying ""oh yea Ive done it before"" Lets say someone in your family died because of their sickness and you spend all those days being depressed and in denial that they are gone but guess what ? You are going to built yourself up and make them proud of whop they raised and who stood by their side and everyday your going to try and make every second count just to make them see how great your handling everything even if sometimes you might get sad here and there but,your still pushing through which is making your character stronger then your seeing it yourself. There are so many times in everyone life were they doubt themselves and want to give up because they think they arent capable of doing something but when youve realized from what youve accomplish the world doesnt seem so scary anymore, your brain will trick and say to you that you cant do it thats impossible and all these negative saying but, why should you focus on that so much thats not getting you through life its just bringing you down and you know that your character isnt meant for that its to push you and get you through all these brick walls that life throws at you only you can knock them down. So dont stop yourself from making a choice you know is right go with your gut and let your heart show you the ways dont let nothing in life stop you from what people think is impossible make it possible stand yourself out, make your character stand out because you are different no matter what. Your life isnt a pick and choose its what you think is best and fits for you so the saying goes ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make"", its your life have fun with it and make everything you do in life built up your character.

96,2442,0D382343F3D7,"Why do curfews interfere with young peoples lives? For some people, they have to stay at work really late because of this reason. A curfew could really mess up someones life when theyre doing something important. No wonder why curfews interfere with young peoples lives and heres the reason. Curfews interfere with young peoples lives because they have to stay at work very late, have to intended to something , and have fun with their friends. However, some people dont agree with this position. They think that a curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble. For example, When the teenager comes home on time, their mother wouldnt be scared where they have gone and why they stay out late. So, this explains why the council thinks that a curfew to young peoples lives could get them out of trouble. However, young people still consider that having a curfew could interfere with their lives and heres the first reason. Going home on time when theyre at work is impossible. For example, some people working at a restaurant stay late some times because of cleaning the dirty dishes or taking a long time to do their side jobs. Also, when theyre working for the government, they have to stay really late because of paper work or something urgent. This shows that having a curfew could make young people really stressed because they would have to rush their side jobs and get home in time. That is one good reason why they shouldnt adopt the curfew and heres the next one. A lot of young people have things to do when theyre out . For example, when the teenagers are in a play, they cant stop the play until its finished or they will ruin the play. When theyre at a school dance,they cant leave if theyre participating the dance or they have a date. Young people sometimes have things to do after hours or want to go and participate. Thats another good reason why the council shouldnt adopted the curfew and heres the last reason. For teenagers, they just want to have fun and stay out late. For example, teenagers like to drive out very late with their friends or drink with them. Also, play games with their friends and stay up until they finish a level or a quest at a arcade or Dave and Busters. A lot of teenagers dont always sleep on time when theyre having fun. That sums everything and heres the closing. In conclusion, this stats that curfews interfere young peoples lives because of them working very late. Also, when, theyre intending in an event. Lastly, when theyre having fun with their friends. This shows that curfews interfere with young peoples lives.

98,2444,9C3D2911E32D,"Have you ever thought of the affect of going out after 10 p. m. at night? Night time is the scariest period of the day; nothing is more dangerous and harmful than at night. People would rather stay at home than going out at night. A city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer, teenagers can stay out of trouble and they can have more time to spend with their family. However, some people think that curfews would unfairly interfere in young peoples lives because they might have an emergency and everyone has freedom to do what they want. In some cases, for instance, teenagers might have an emergency or something important at night that they need to be there as soon as possible, city council cannot let them stay at home. It will be unfair if other people can go out at night, but not teenagers. Everyone has freedom to do what they want, others cannot force teenagers to stay at home everyday after 10 p. m. at night. Although some people think that having curfews are not a good idea, I still insist that the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a fantastic idea. In the first place, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer. It is very scary if teenagers hang out at night because someone might follow or kidnap them without they notice. No one knows what is going to happen next. Staying at home not only keep teenagers safe, it also make them be caution to everything around them. Furthermore, teenagers need to protect themselves from others, so that they will not get hurt. In short, it is necessary to adopt curfews for teenagers because they will be safer. Additionally, it is important for teenagers to have curfews because they can stay out of trouble. Teenagers nowadays have a very playful mind and they would do anything to enjoy themselves; however, they can get into trouble very quickly. Curfews can prevent and stop teenagers from breaking the law. They can stay at home and do something productive and meaningful to themselves. Moreover, curfews can prevent teenagers to meet harmful people outside of the society and make a bad decision. Therefore, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because they can stay out of trouble. Lastly, it is a great idea for a city council to adopt a 10 p. m. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers because they can have more time to spend with their family. Spending time with their family is the best moment that nobody wants to miss. Instead of going out with people below standard and breaking the rules, teenagers can have a wonderful time with their family at home. Because of curfews, the relationship between teenagers and their family will grow and be healthier. To sum up, it is nice to have curfews because it helps build up a better relationship. In conclusion, it is the best idea to have a city council adopt curfews for teenagers because it can protect teenagers from danger and risk, they will less likely get into future conflicts, and they can have an enjoyable time to spend with their family. Curfew benefits both teenagers and the law. Curfews can raise the world to a higher level and make a clean society for all teenagers. Lets make the adoption of curfews come true!

Everyone has a talent or a skill? do you have a talent or skill that you have practice for or worked so hard for that skill? Well one of my strongest skills is swimming You know not everyone can swim right well now I can unlike the time I was drowning well from that experience I have learned not to jump in the deep side of the pool. Well I can swim and an important talent to have or else you will probably end up like me but swimming is one of my talents I love swimming and im good at it and i learned to swim by myself. Although talents and skills are nice to have but some times you just have to work for them like if you want a skill that requires a lot of effort then you have to prepare yourself. Practice and practice it makes perfect trust me thats why every one says it, because its true and thats why im such a strong swimmer. Every time that I went to a pool or river to have fun with my family I always tried swimming failed a lot but every time I fell I would force myself to get up and try once more. takes a lot of work and money to be a good swimmer. In the summer I always begged my mom to go to the pool sometimes she took me and sometimes not but for the times that we went I put all my effort into it. Effort, effort is a big part of obtaining a skill. It all just depends on your part of the process. The process mite be long or the process mite be short it all depends . in conclusion every one has a talent or skill. skills and talents take time, practice, and effort, what talents and skills do you have and if you dont like the skills and talents that you already have learn anther one it doesnt take much.

One reason i would like to be selected is because i would put one hundred percent of my attention and actually participate in all task we would have in the internships. A reason i would like a shadowing opportunities is because i would like to see how a manager would deal with situations if a problem would ever happen when i would work. Shadowing would also be great for students would like to know how to make the job a little bit easier and faster to not waste time and sit around until a manager shows up and fixes the problem so they could start working again, thats why a shadow opportunities would be great to actually see how a manager would deal with a situation, so then would later that we as interns would deal with the problems instead of calling a manager and waiting for him to solve it. Shadowing is something i have never done before, ive always had interviews and get told that what i would be doing in a job that i applied for but have never really done it before getting hired to see if i would really would like the job i applied too, thats why our school gave us the chance to have the chance to be selected to be able to see if we would actually committed to the job we like and be ready to work.

104,2450,6686DB25FBD0,"I believe that gaining life experience and learning from your mistakes and working hard, comes when we are always doing something and accomplish more. Accomplish more and always doing something is important to me because it gives me more opportunity to be successful in life . To begin with,by practicing playing my favorite sport ,soccer everyday after school and on my free time; because I was in my school team and I was really bad and weak at it .Practicing helped me to overcome my weakness and to learn from my mistakes ,and also to know the rules of the game and basis of soccer. Some people believe inactivity serve a purpose that led you to success;however, we gain life experience and learning from our mistakes if we are always doing something or we accomplished more . Also,by practicing soccer everyday and working hard on it,I learned tricks and how to kick the ball directly to my teammates and how to be good goal keeper and catch the ball as well. And that gives me more experience and strength to continue. Another example,one day we were playing and their was judgments there,choosing the best player to be in the ""International Soccer Team"" ,depending on how the player plays and how they follow the rules. Three days later, I got nominated to participate in the International team and I also got honored for being the best player in the game and of course, that led me to successful opportunity in the future. In conclusion, by working hard and always doing something makes, you to gain life experience and more opportunities and to accomplish more. To accomplish something is not easy, you have to face a lot of difficulties and facing those difficulties and get over it thats what meant by accomplish .It will walk you through a lot to accomplish something in your life, you just have to keep going and to work hard and never give up and all of that will pays off by being success in your life .",5,6,7,7,6,7,1335,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
105,2451,CD7201C66BBC,"Students being able to graduate a year early from high school is excellent choice for any lower clansmen thinking of graduating early in the up coming school year. In the past years lots of high schools have witness a portion of students graduating early due to the students choice in education. Not only does the student have the choice, but gains more responsibility, and thinks about his college future. Every student should have that choice in graduating early since they have every right. Having the choice to graduate early probably sounds like a pretty good idea, to any lower class men trying to see his options in high school. High school choices are pretty slim but knowing you have that option during your 4 years of high school, means you could take that challenge and overcome the odds from everyone else not taking that choice. A student taking that choice is well aware and willing to take full responsibility on his choices. Gaining responsibility through out this path, is great for a student to obtain. Obtaining responsibility shows a lot in a character, because having this trait takes you far in life, and shows you dont procrastinate in completing a task. In all Honesty responsibility is a major key in a student looking to graduate early, a reason is because you are getting double the work, taking all core classes, and multiple tests happening throughout the week. Just by having double the education in a single year takes a lot from a student, but having that commitment and responsibility shows, and proves a lot in a hardworking student trying to graduate early. Working hard and succeeding in graduating early is gonna look good, in a students resume for college. One of the reasons a student could graduate ahead of time, is most likely because they wanna get straight to college. Going to college is probably on every high school students mind right about now, but colleges will automatically notice a change in the students class, and be aware of them graduating ahead of time. Colleges noticing the students activity is a good thing for them, because they notice how the student is ready to take another step in their life, and willing to put a lot of effort in their tuition as well, just by doing this they could take a lot of consideration in allowing the student to attend their college. Overall graduating early is a great choice for a high school student looking into this option. All students in every school district, should all have that choice for themselves. If the student makes their choice they should take into consideration that they will need to take a lot of responsibility in completing all task through the year for all core classes taken. Lastly to take note that colleges have a good eye for them, and seeing the choices they make and how they are doing through their high school years.

107,2453,F9FEE5DC1640,"Imagination and knowledge are all come from you mine, but what are the different between those two? Scientist Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Im agree with him, because if you take a class like art or computer graphs, you dont really need your knowledge, the most important thing you need, is your imagination. It can help you do better in the class. first, the different between Imagination and knowledge is you dont need to rember the knowledge, and sometimes people have hard time to remberm. So you just need to think you like to do, and you dont need to follow the knowledge what you learn. Im that kind of person that dont like to rember things, but I like to do what in my mine want to do. We have a lot knowledge need to learn, and we never finished learning, but we can use our imagination to do more things that is helpful to the world. I guess, everybody like to play video games, but do you know how they make the games up? I did create app club this fall, first I thought we will create some app what other people already create it before, but than the teacher told us that, everybody will be create in they are own app, I dont know what kind of app I want to create, and told the teacher said, ""can I create a one somebody just create it before?"" ""No, you cant, you need to be imagination, just think of what you want to do, and what kind of app you like."" She answer. the end of the due day, I use my imagination to create a game app. From this class I learn that imagination is more important than knowledge. Imagination and knowledge are both important, but imagination is a little better than knowledge, we can use our imagination to do more helpful things to our beautiful world. In our life we have too much knowledge need to learn, we need to keep learning and nerve stop. ",6,5,6,5,5,5,3764,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
108,2454,6B2FD789B8C8,"To converse energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. This model will be helpful for students, and teachers at same time. By giving them more time to relax. It be the best option for students because it will give them more time to experience, learn new information in a young age. We all as a student need more time to prepare for future, and work as hard as possible to pass our classes. Furthermore, same for the teachers, they will be able to have more time with their families; and they can enjoy their lives with three days weekend. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because teachers and students will have more time to relax, to grow and achieve more, and to help others. We all need to relax, specially if we are a student because school is so stressful, and two days weekend will not give enough time to students to relax. Two days weekend will just be enough for students to spend time with their families and do their homework; it will not give them time for themselves. Moreover, by two days weekend students can not relax and work for themselves. I personally rather to have more time during the weekend because I will have more time to finish everything that I wanted to do during the week, and I will have time to relax. During the weekdays students can learn more and they will have more time in school to spend with their friends. Some people think that three days weekend will make students forget what they learned during the week. But they are wrong because students will have more time to go over what they learned, and they have enough time to practice more. Most of the people loves to exercise, read, meditate, and swim in their free times. Three days weekend will give students and teachers more free time to care about themselves. Most of my friends love to exercise, but some of them gave up on exercising because they dont have time to do it. They are working Saturdays and studying on Sundays. One of my teachers told me, that she loves to read book in weekends, but she does not have time to read because she has a lot of work to do. Reading, exercising, meditating, and swimming will help human to grow and learn more to achieve more. Also, four days weekdays will teach students to work harder. Some people think that students and teachers should not have longer weekend than usual because they have winter break, and spring break. But they are wrong because longer weekend can help both students and teachers to care more about themselves by giving them free time. Some of the students love to help others, by volunteering. Three days weekend will increase students chances to help others because they will have more time to do it. My sister loves to volunteer and help other; she is volunteering once a month. She told me that she wants to increase it and do it more, but she can not because she has a lot of homework and she does not have time. Although, their are a lot of students who need help in some of their classes because they have a bad grade. If we give the students more time to study, they will get better grades. Last year during winter break, my math teacher told me that I have to try harder and study more, I told him that I can not understand the notes. We met in the public library and he helped me to study. He said, ""I love to help students outside of school, but I dont have time to do it"". I think we have a lot of teachers like that, who wants to help students outside of school, but they dont have time. If we have longer weekends, teachers will be able to help more students. Some people think that schools should have two days weekend because they are not getting tired. But they are wrong teaching and learning are the most hardest things in the world. To converse energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. And this will help students and teachers to have more time to relax, to care about themselves, and to help others. Students can have more time with their families, to grow, and to work harder and achieve their goals. Furthermore, teachers are also the same, teachers need more time to spend with their families and kids, and they will be able to plan what are they going to do, or what they want to do with certain students who needs help. Also, in weekdays they can learn more, or teach more. Which it is a great opportunity to both of them to achieve more.

But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling. Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people dont finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they cant reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country. Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there were more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand. Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldnt say a word because I didnt know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we were just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came. Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day. ",6,7,8,7,7,7,1725,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

If you sell concrete and do Excavation and commercial your company can grow a lot and you will do more what you Mastered and can grow a lot from that. You need to have a lot of ideas and experiences what you are doing. If you think you can do something or achieve more do it because you can grow a lot from doing that.

Ive learned to play different instruments such as: the guitar, percussion, xylophone, and the violin, which is what im currently playing. At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade. Since I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. when I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade ,so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade. I really felt passionate about the violin so I kept playing ,and still am ,and yet will continue until high school.

Last year, I sang a song ,that I composed, for my sisters birthday. She really enjoyed it.

115,2461,E69D5E1FEAB4,"should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matter? one of the common questions i get ask. Many people have different thoughts about this questions, my opinion is depending the sittuation. For example people can learn from there dicision but in other hand listening to peoples advice can stop you from doing wrong. Ever since i was little i always wanted to make my own decision and wont have to listen to no one but i the more i got older i realized that sometimes what people say to do can turn out to be better then the decision you took. Making your own decision can make you more independent and know how life works and those are the people we look up too. Depending on the situation your in listening to others give us life lesson can be one of the most unforgetables momments because that show you they care and want the best for you because maybe they didnt end up making the right decision and want you to prevent from doing it .

So I think that is more benefit working in group that working alone because it make easily the things. First, the first thing we do is give the kids breakfast, and while the kids are eating two of the ladies are looking after them, and the others two, are planning the activity that the kids are going to be doing during the day and try to keep them busy. Also all ladies give ideas and at the end we try to put all ideas together and work on it as a team. While the day is passing, we do everything we need to teach and do the activities, and working all together is easily for us to finish early. when we finish early we always read or dance until the time to go home comes. Also we disgust who was the one that behave was good and we also give stars for the behavior to kids. Sometimes the kid dont behave well and if there were only one person taking care of the kids it most be difficult to do what we all four need to do. Also, everyone goal is to keep the kids safe,having fun, and also learning who to write, so at the time for them go to school they are going to feel relative and dont be scare of going to a regular school. And when that happen is how we know that we make a work together. As you see, I feel that is more beneficial working together in a group because, everyone in the group has ideas, is easily to finnish everything fast and also everyone has the same goal.",5,6,6,5,4,6,3797,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

He might be paying people to find a cure for the Coronavirus. However did you know that we use math every single day in our life? How do people use math every single day you may ask. When you go to the super market to buy food, the register has to add all the food that you bought and they even have to add taxes. How about when you go shopping in the mall with some friends. When some is looking for a job they even have to find out how much is the salary. When your parents pay water bills and taxes, they have to pay the perfect amount of money. If your doing a party you have to find how much money your wasting. In your school you have to use math in mostly all your subject. In science you have find out how much of a mass is in a cup of water then subtract it from the cup to find the mass of water. For history the president has to find out about expensives and the taxes that each citizens is paying. If you have a hobby or have talents to do an activity you even use math. In theater arts you have to measure and subtract where the lights are hitting and you have to find the perfect angel. In baking you have to add your ingredients and weight it to find its mass. When you cook dont tell me you just put random stuff in your pot. You have to find the perfect amount to feed the people you are feeding. In soccer you have to find the angle you are going to kick the soccer ball. Basketball is the same, you have to see from which angel you are going to throw the ball to make a point for your team. Here are some school activitys that you use math in your school. Science History Art Theater Art Sports Cooking Class Home After school programs However several kids dont like math but they could try it in a fun way. Many children complain about math being to hard or just being boring. I have found a way to make it exciting for kids. They could be playing games or just pretending to buy stuff, like doing a little play that wont cost money. If a student likes painting give them a coloring book that has math in it. Dancing and music is the same thing like coloring. In music you can count how many strings a violin has and compare it to another instrument that is in the violin family. You can watch a funny video that is related to math, you can watch it in your home or in school. Go on a field trip that will be free or that wont cost that much money. If a student is struggling in math help or show them a way to do it. A kids classmates or friend could help them in math. They can use math websites like racing cars for boys and coloring games for girls. If they are still struggling then ask there parents if they can stay or to get them a tutor after school. Find them a easier and understandable way to teach them math. The childs teacher can even play fun games with her students like Kahoot,Quizlet live, or even Pear Deck. You can give out prizes like candy or stickers, that will probably get them more exciting. Many scientist say that math is helpful to your brain and makes it healthy for you and your brain. You will acknowledge many ways to solve several math problems from years to years until you graduate from collage or high school. The reason why I choose to do my lesson about math is that I want kids to be independent and to get responsible when they grow up to be adults.

Students not learn to much because they do not receive a good explication about the class as a real teacher would to explains in the school, not have rulers and online classes not catches the students attention. Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them. Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they dont have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home. Online classes or videos conferencing not catchs the students attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home and you are at the midpart of one the lesson but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allows that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and morer. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge abou it. Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students. They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades. Other say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details.. They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing. As you can see, taking online classes or videos conferencing from home, not helps the students to learn because if they are confusing they will get bad grades , nobody answer their question or doubts and they dont have rulers or limited to use any electronics devices.

Beside that, they also need to release stressful after two or three hours from studying. Its a good condition for students to recharge and heighten their energy for the next efficient block when they take the classes of art but it wastes time for students who wont spend time to practice it. Today, studying in high school, which turns to boring with almost students because they cant locate where they are, what they are interested in at school. In that case, finding the funny things, which is the best way to counter that situation, is helping us to reduce stressful and recharge us from hold blocks study. For example, there are multiple choices for us like enrolling a band, joining a drama, taking part in an art class for making motivation in studying . We must be required to take those classes because that also is what we choose. Beside that, choosing to sign up an art class are not only helping students to clean up their brain, which become easily to adopt information from the following block, but also increase efficient- adoption. For instance, after a serious block with full information in our brain, we must to clean it up by singing, acting or drawing class, it will help our brain feel relaxing and ready for adopting more information. It also depends on our type of favorite in entertainment that your body and brain can feeling relax when we are into it. We agree that every students should be required to take those classes but if such classes wont be electives to select students natural abilities; a huge students, who arent serious about a music, a drama, an art class, will make other students feel uncomfortable. Like they are going to sleep or make noise which effect to everybody around to enjoy their fresh time. To sum up, we know students should take a class from arts to make them feel fresh after a tired day or two to three blocks in a row to recharge and make our adoptive abilities improving; it help students produce motivation from school and make them feel comfortable without pressure. But classes of art still need to be electives to choose which students own availability to take part in that class to make sure they dont waste time in the block they even arent interested in.

121,2467,97C6E22BA8EE,"Working alone will always be a better progress to your knowledge. Some people think that is better to work in group than by yourself. But many famous people has shared their own stories of life and it show how working alone can open your brain to another level and acomplish more of what others think that just can be done in group. I read an old story of my favorite wrestler , and he explained how he worked really hard at the gym to become one of the best wrestler man in the whole story;thats why I think is better to work alone because working alone help to increase your understanding , it show that you are willing to grow on your own, and it will be one more step forward of your knowledgy. Consider,for a moment, working alone will help to increase your understanding and if working alone have so many people on the top of hall of fame why we should not try to be one of those people , but to be one of those people we need to work harder than ever. However, people must work alone and they must feel the pain of the hard work that they need to get done. Furthermore,to increase your understanding you must try to learn or do something new every single day of your life, In order to see the result of the hard work that you are doing , does not matter if that is a meantal or physical work as long as you are doing a safe work to succed in those goals. Besides, working by yourself is safer than working in group and when people work alone it show the desires to grow by their own experiences because a lot of times we trust people that we should not trust for many reason as envious of what you are cusseding at, pervert people in your group doing the wrong work that they should not do,and many times they do the wrong work just to see you down or because they are not interesting on the topic or kind of work than the group supposed to be doing. According with paragraph one ,working alone will definitely take you to succed in your goals and you will get each of your goals done. However, you must be focus and give all the motivation to those dreams that you have in life. There is a lot of people that think is better to be working in group than by ourselves because five heads think better than a single one. True , I agrees that five heads think better than one , but how about not every menber in the group is agree with the topic or the material that they are working on; what could happen there is problems between themselves because none of them have the same goals or thoughts. Moreover, it could even cause discussiones with teachers, and it will be worse for the group, so which means working alone would be the best option for everyone to take. That way every person can work on their goals and express their diffrent thoughts without getting into discussions. Concluding with paragraph one,two and three, working alone would be the best fit to you to acomplish everything you want as long as you work for it,. That is why I always try to work alone in all ways because it help to discover new things , a new person inside of you, but also it help to push yoursel forward and always do your best in every single thing that you do on your own because at the end of the way whatever you acomplish,that is gonna be your legacy,. If it were up to me , working alone would definitelly be the first option to people to take in a classroom or any place that you are working on.

Lastly,people would just think its plain old dumb if you believe in that. I think people would think your crazy because if you keep living on your imagination then youll get to stcuk in your own little games your in,and youll sometimes forget what the real world thinks of you. The worst to come is that youll get to scared to come to even go out into the real world. Knowledge is a powerful thing that everyone has,and its more powerful than your own imagination.

That is what the Former British Prime Minster once said that ""Success consits of going from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiam.""

It feels extraordinary to be successful in life but to fail is something that no one likes including to success. Its understandable to make mistakes because you can learn from them and try again until you get it right. No one is perfect,its understanding to make a couple of mistakes here and there knowing you can learn from it. Everyone wants to be successful in life or in anything.

Some people believed that going beyond what you have already mastered is not a great way to accomplished becuase you will never grow and that will lead you to fall back and it is beneficial because you have already accomplished. In my opinion going beyond what you have already mastered is a great way to achieved more goals and the more steps you take the more experience you will get than just focusing on what you have already mastered,because achieving more and taking risk in every journey that you made is a great way to know how important each step you take is and going beyond that will prove how strong and passionate you are to be more successful. For example if you are in a soccer team and your team had already won three goal that should not give you the risk to relax and think that you have already mastered what you were trying to get ,go beyond that and play more harder and get to were you want to be until you feel accomplished that will give you the courage to try to do more and never look down. Another reason why people should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered is it will set an example to the public by showing how ethusiatic you are in any part that you take ,because you are aiming to get more and win more and you will be a role model to the young generation, For example if someone is trying to let go because they had already got what they want they will take you as a mentor, because you at the other side never stop even though you have already mastered and accomplished more but you are still aiming to get more and you are still growing. Another reason to go beyond is it will impact you in your after life and you will also feel proud that you never let go you take risk you go beyond your thought, for eaxample you another person who have already mastered what they want and they feel good withwhat they have already get and you gop beyond that makes you a hero.

Hang around people with that attitude and i promise you, you yourself will succeed be happy in and out and have a positive attitude. Life is always gonna have its ups and downs shoot, shoot im only a 17 year old boy and i had lots of barriers lots of downs lots of fake people that have came in and out of my life but my mother that mistakes are the beauty in life that you learn from them and prosper and grow dont let that change your attitude because it will change the way you think the way you talk i can go on and on about how a positive attitude can make you a better person and be successful in life. Having a negative attitude is just negative and thats a ugly word being negative can impact you in so many ways at work nobody wants to hire a rude or behaved person because it would make the company look bad make your parents look bad and make you look bad. a negative attitude can bring, negative, thoughts negative actions and nobody wants that. even at home having and bad attitude and mama and thats a attitude you are going to regret when you get a smack across the face. So yes i strongly agree that a positive attitude will take you a long way. Make you a better person and last make you successful person in life. Stay positive in a negative situation because it will make things ten times worse if you are mad or down learn to heal yourself time a time out step outside take a breather and think before you say or do. life is beautiful but its makes it ugly if you attitude is ugly so change it and make yourself a better. healthier person. i know this is out of the promt but to be succesful in life and to be what you wanna be you have to do that yourself nobody is going to do it for you. but first START OFF with making YOURSELF HAPPY for you not for anyone else.

I think that a science experiment could be enjoyable because you can learn new things with your friends,you can work on the experiment with you friends,and you can talk to other people about what you got or learned First,i think that science experiments could be enjoyable because you can learn new things with your friends. Sometimes your friends wont figure out things as fast as you or they might not figure it out,so you can explain to them how you figured it out and maybe they figured out something you havent yet so they might teach you about what they got to. Later on in the school year you might be asked on a test or quiz about the thing that you learned. When you get home and your parents ask you what you learned you can tell them and explain it to them. Second,i think that science experiments could be enjoyable because you can do the science experiment with your friends. If you do it with your friends you can have fun. You could have time to talk to them about the science experiment that your doing, Also you could work together on it and get a good grade. Lastly,i think that science experiment could be enjoyable because you can talk to other people outside of your group about what you got and learned. Lets say that you went to another group to see what they figured out and they tell you something you dont agree with,so you could explain to him or her about what you got and how you got it and then you can ask the teacher and figure out who was wrong. You can learn from what they got and add it to your work. I think that a science experiment could be enjoyable because you can learn new things with your friends,you can work on the experiment with you friends,and you can talk to other people outside of your group about what you got or learned.

Fifty percent of all people go through depression, anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns because theres nobody there to help them, sometimes when you try to help they just either ignore you or they just dont want to be spoken too that means they havent been seeking help. A person who has a companion can be going through things too you know, but they express themselves to their best friend but for more help you can talk to your specialist doctor. Doctors and authorities are really a good help, they hear you out and always agree with you. Experts should be people who are very close to you it could be a neighbor, family relative, family members, your boss, coworkers and even your friends. Authorities sometimes dont really help you when your having mental breakdowns because sometimes they dont care or its not their business.

133,2479,C444D6A0AC1C,"Although, many people believe that extracurricular activities can enrich students educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study and complete their homework assignments. This decision should solve with their families, because this decision shouldnt made by school, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other student or get involved with different team works, and some student dont want to do or stay after school program or any other extracurricular activities. First, whether student wants to join or do extracurricular activities they should ask parents or families first, because some parents dont wants to do the extracurricular activities. Example, some students have a lot of homework, project, tests or their different school works. Some parents dont want let the kids or students to do the extracurricular activities because of their other school works. This can cause their student fail the school or other stuff can happened to them. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by families not by schools. Then, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other students or get involved with team works. Some school wants students to do join clubs, sports, and any other after school program, because some after school program needs students to do join their program by forcefully. Example some sports coach ask to do join their team but the student dont want to join for some kind of reason, and sometime they email or call to their parents to let them join our programs. Some student dont want to join any after school program for some reason. This is why after school program or extracurricular activities should made by families decision. Lastly, some student dont want to stay after school program or any other activities. Some student are already tired from school example, some students is already taking lot of extra classes at school and they probably have lot of test and quiz or even homework. If they decided to do after school program or any other extracurricular activities then its up to their families choice, but most of students dont want to stay after school because they already have lots of homework, projects, prepare for their quiz and tests. If school wants to control student to get involve with any other after school activities then it can cause students grades, lack of sleep, and other stuff can happen to students. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by their families or by parents. This is why I want parents or families to make a decision about after school programs. This is the three reason that I want families make a decision about after school programs not by school. Although many people believe that school should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. For me I disagree that school should not make a decision for students, decision should made by students families or by their parents for my three reasons.

134,2480,89A2B91E59C5,"I know that having career coarses is a great idea for students to identify their careers in High-school. By studying coarses in High-school it will teach students the requirements for specific careers and prepare students for college and thier career if not required for college after High-school. Having career coarses will make students more confident and comfortable in thier first year in college or thier first day at work becasue students will already be knowledgeable about what thier doing, and it will also give students a headstart in life and which makes students well prepared. Having career coarses will give a variety of choices for students and will help them figure out what they might want to study. These coarses will teach students requirements, basics, and will give them an idea of what they might want to study in college or a career after High-school. When students are getting ready to leave High-school some students still might not know what to study, but having career coarses would solve that solution easily which will cause less depression and stress. There are four years in High-school which is enough time for students to switch out of a career coarse if thier arent intrested. If High-schools dont take advantage of this idea students will be pure pressured to go to college and study a random coarse which isnt right if thier not intrested, that could lead them to drop out of college and waste thousands of dollars and could maybe go in debt for the rest of thier lives. Career coarses In High-school will give students headstarts which is very beneficial for students and professors in college. College professors wont have to teach the basics, but will go over them which would save time and this also means students will have a couple of extra time for tests and final exams. Having career coarses in High-school will cost a lot of money, but why not spend it if are main focus is to educate the students and help them suceed in the future. After religous beliefs school is the second most important thing in the world. These students are our future and we want the world to be a better place and have a better society. We should reach out to the school board and colleges and let them know, By emailing, calling, or just by using social media that this is a very important matter and it would be very benefical for both them and us as students, We want to suceed and be educated and having career coarses is the best way possible, we dont want to go in debt for the rest of our lives for something we didnt enjoy doing in college we want to be well prepared and every student should have equal opportunities in the world to know what to study.

135,2481,C02F3803D0D1,"People think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree with that because impressions is just what you think, always make you think different things, and you never know whats gonna happen. Impressions is like when you thought somethings, its just what you think about someone or something. For example:My impression is that she is not telling me the truth. you think that shes not telling you the truth but you dont know the truth. Impressions can make you think different or bad just because how you look at someone or something. For example: If you see someone that has a bad looking, your impression is that he might be poor but, you can change your impression if you see that he has the Iphone of the year, or he has a Lamborghini, so it can make you think different. When women get pregnant they always get impress and trying to guess what the baby is gonna be. For example: When my mom got pregnant and she had me, her impression was that it was gonna be a girl, and she wanted a girl, but here i am, 18 years old, a big boy and she was impress and sad, but when she see that i was very handsome her impression change shes happy now. Some people believe that just with their impression you are what they say. Next time you think that the first impression is impossible to change, you have to think the first impression does not say everything about a person or something. I hope you never impress by something or someone, that can be different that you thought, thats why we dont judge, God is the only one who can judge.",4,6,6,6,6,7,2593,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 4"

We could be farther but some people are always lazy and dont like doing nothing. Those people gotta get out of there house and do something for that world each person can change the world a little but at least they are doing something.

First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream and horse back riding. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesnt feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley. Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for biology and start staying home she get discourage that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay for her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible.",5,6,7,6,6,6,2781,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Theres many reasons on why I believe this, but due to the character limitation, Im only going to name a few reasons. One of the first reasons I believe this is because of discovery. When someone goes out on a new adventure, they can only imagine on what they can find. When they do find something new, they use their imagination to find out what it can do, what it haas inside, or what does it do for the enviroment. Once they do figure out somethinng about it, they get the knowledge from it. Its honsetly cool on how much we know because of our imagination. Another reason on why I believe this way is because of what we created over the past years. Weve created so many wonderful things and a few mistakes over the past years. When sommeone wants to invents something, they use their imagination and knowledge of the world around them to make it. If you want a job on where creativity has no boundries, then you should become either an animator or a game developer. I choose to be both, but mostly being game developer. When someone get inspired to make someone, they use the knowledge of their inspiration and their own imagination to create something wonderful or a mistake that should never been released on this world. I honestly do that too. Ive takeen the knowledge from the games and animations I liked to come up with something in which I hope many people will injoy. Theres plenty more reasons that I cant really come up with but Im sure that you get my point. Imagination and knowledge work together to improve this world as we know it. Prime examples of this are discovery and creativity. If everyone can use these two things together, Im sure that well come up with something wonderful or something thatll most likely mess up the planet forever.",7,8,8,8,7,8,345,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

About 5% of the ocean is discovered and our earth is made of 75% water and 25% land. Marine biology is a job were you work with animals. there is so much you could do as a marine biologist. for example, you could swim with animals and collect data, you would work in a lab to find cures with animals, you could even not directly with animals but research about them. The ocean is an amazing place and is full of magnificent creatures. i would love to swim with sea life and help them in any way i can. if i see an animals caught in a net. I would try and save it. If there were animals in a bad situation such as injured, harmed, caught. I would help it. so many animals are killed every year. either for clothes, food, wild fire, pollution, loss of habitat, etc. over 700,000 thousand animals are killed every year. that includes sea life and land life. So many animals that are endangered like the black rhino. the great white shark, etc just from poaching. sharks are hunted for their fins and then just tossed back into the ocean to die. same goes for the black rhino. they are hunted for there horns and then just left to die. i want to accomplish saving some animals when i grow up. In the ocean coral reefs are dyeing because of people and habitat distraction. some people think that coral reefs are just rocks growing out of other rocks but they are actually animals and they are living and breathing just like us. maybe they dont have noses like us they are animals and they should be treated like animals. in ten years we would have lost 100% of our coral reefs. That doesnt mean that all the coral reefs are gone it means that there wouldnt be enough coral reefs are a good habitat. Animals need coral reefs to live in and hide from predators like bigger fish. So many animals died from plastic just drifting in the ocean. there are more than 1 million plastic being dumped into the ocean each year. Sea life dies from plastic by getting stuck in it or eating since its not biodegradable. In the future i want to help sea life with all the plastic and at least help out with it. a lot of animals even get stuff and grow up with plastic stuck on them or in them. there is this turtle when it got caught in a tip tie. the tip tie was stuck around its shell and it couldnt get out so it just grew around it and deformed the shell. when helpers saw the turtle they took the zip tie off of the turtle and the the turtle was free but its shell was still deformed from the zip tie. when people are recycling they should at least up the bottle holders so if it does get in the sea and a animal finds it. it is less likely to get stuck in it. turtles eat jellyfish so when there is a plastic bag floating in the ocean. the turtle thinks its a jellyfish and eats it. after some time the turtle might die because it cant digest the plastic. i want to accomplish visiting the ocean and go diving, snorkeling, touch wild life and help out with injured animals.

145,2491,D80ED2446C0E,"Setting examples by your own behavior to influence other people is better for many reasons but still has its pros and cons. My first reason why is because the majority people around world learn and comprehend better when they have an example in front them. In addition it is easier to influence others by your behavior becuase you experience it everyday and it would be very easy to set an example. My second reason is setting examples makes you a leader and when other people start to notice it they will strive to act upon that action because they where influenced and want to become a leader like you,soon more and more people will start doing it. There is only one con and that is depending on the individual and situation that person might not be good at making self behavior examples because they may have not experienced it before but there is a solution for this problem. You can ask a smart adult and act upon there actions and carry it on. Nobody is perfect and its okay to ask for help sometimes. In conclusion setting examples by your own behavior to influence others is a smart thing to do and youll be surprised by how many people youve influenced.

148,2494,E52C094A1DAA,"Having good attitude can be helpful by, helping others when they have a hard time in something, and when you and I are going through tough times, you can also have a good attitue a good minset on what your doing. A way of having a good attitude is by seeing things n the bright side of things, even though its bad. Another reason why having a good attitude is important, is because people appreciate when someone gives them a good feeling either their sad or mad. Another reason why its important to have a good attitude is becasue you get things done properly, for an example, when you have to do a project due in two days you take your time and dont rush, you do things with a good attitude. If not your project will be at the end a mess, and youre going to be frusterated. Having a good atitude is impotant because, you can help other when theyre going trough tough times, for an example, whn my mom was sick and she was dealing with asma, we had to take her to the ER mant times. It was sad for me to see her all sick, not only that but she was pregnat and couldnrt anything because she had acid reflux. So whenever she felt sad and stressed out, I knew I had to support her and have a good attitude. By having a good attitude I had to help her with some house hold things because she couldnt really do anything. Another reason of having a good attitude is by also having a good mindset, because when you have a good minset you can go through your tough times easly. And when you are stresse out abput something you have to have a good minset and a good attitude. For an example when I had to deal with by spine problembecause my disk was moved,I had to hae a good attitude because if I am ther complaining about my pain, its not going to help me. So if I just relax and take rest and tak my medications then I will have a good attitude, because I know that everything will be okay. So this is why having a good attitude is very helpful, because you can help others when they are going through tough times, or whenever you and I are going through tough times, and how it helps you succed in things.",6,7,7,6,7,6,3308,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
149,2495,82F7210163B5,When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn. For me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school everyday. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home. Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate. Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Some students cant catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught. Finally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level. Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student. ,7,7,8,8,7,7,1728,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
150,2496,2A2AE5FB899F,"One topic that is frequently debated today is, if the amount of work days should change to less then five days to four with the idea of conserve energy and resources. Many people think the school should reduce the day of school. Some people believe that is a good idea to conserve this value and important resources. I think this idea will not make a good change because many student will be affected with this idea they work after school, we will have less time to do wherever we want, and it is difficult to everybody to stay focus ten hours in the school. To being, just imagine all the students how work after school, everyone have a limit in our bodys and minds to do different activities every single day. If for the students how they dont work after school it is really difficult to stay on time with they homework, think about the students that only get home and just change their cloths, maybe eat something at home or just wait for a break in the work. A lot of students have to pay their own food, clothes, and even a lot of them pay rent. If the school finish at six, they will have less time to make money to live, that is one of the big situations that a lot of teenagers live every day. Now think about the increment of the time in the school and all the effects that will have. Therefore, our second reason is we will have less time to do wherever we want or wherever we need to do. If the school finish at six only in one hour or more, the night come out. If you want to play soccer on the grass you cant because is to dark, a lot of stores close early, if you want to buy something you couldnt because probably the stores are closed at that time. when we got home our parents probably are not even there, many of them have to work on night. we only will have four hours to do at less something that we want to do or we need to do starting from six to teen with the idea of that is the time to go to sleep. However, it is difficult to stay focus ten hours in the school. More time in the school, more time of homework or even more classes to take. We will have even less time to do any activity after school, because we will not have enough time to finish our work. With all the material that we have to finish we being to stress out and not doing good in the school. In conclusion, the amount of day at school is not necessary to change to less them five days and steel the same time, everyone get tired and sometime everyone only need a rest to continue day by day. We can fiend better ways to conserves this values resources, reduce the time of work and school will not make a big change. what about all the companies that only want to make money and they dont even care about the resources in our planet just keep doing money and destruction. sleep well if one of the most important needs of our body. If we have less time in the afternoon to do ,what we need to do we will not go to sleep early. We cant follow the same routine every single day, after school we can: play soccer, go to shopping, go to the movies. A lot of different activities that we can do, like one famous quote say "" It is more time,then life "" . We could do better with more time on our hands.

On this paper I will argue about how students have benefits attend classes from home, and how improves skills for he future. I think that students would have benefits for attend classes from home, because is a new opportunity for study more, and for improve more the skills more online classes for the future. Teenagers that are attend classes from home I think will be more healthy, because that means that students will be more able to sleep , and will be have more time to rest the brain, and more time to do all the things at home, because a lot of students they do not sleep during the night the reason, because they work others that always talks with a friends and others that they use technology, and waking up at the early morning make the students brain tired, and makes the students do nothing at school for the rest of the day. Students will be more organizing there time meaning that students will be able to have more time to have job, or do others activities during the day, or after taking classes online, because when they attend to school they do not manege very good the time they always doesnt care about time or do something important. Students will be putting more attention to classes, because when teenagers attend to school most of the things that distract the students are the friends and the technology means that teenagers when are around friends distract the mind out of the class, and that causes that students dont pass the class, or the test, otherwise when are taking classes from home there is no body around that can distract and loss the attention of the students and will be more easy to do homework, projects, and study for test. Some people say that the idea of students attend classes online from home will have more benefits is a bad idea, because they say,""Teenagers are lazy, and they will sleep more late at night"". Students taken classes online will be more smart, because there will more practice skills for the future where will be benefits of know how classes are doing online, and they where taking. On the future students will be able to attend classes from home, and will have benefits for skills, and this will make the teachers more easy to turn any work or practice any class that they missed, and that way students can have more ideas how will things will change and compare between attend to school and take classed online.",6,6,6,6,5,6,1086,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Im firmly agree to Churchill words, no matter what, you have to keep the enthusiasm and keep working hard to get success. There is a lot of difficult parts in the life for example I was a clearly example of this because I went to failure to get success. When I was in 10 grade I take for the first time the Geometry Test, I was so nervous because I was going to take one of most difficult exams that I have never take it and yes I fail and then I take it 3 more times and I fail again.

Finally after 4 times I pass it, and this situation give a big lesson never, never loss the enthusiasm never give up, failure make me learn new things that will help me to improve and be success. One of my reason for this should be that I have to had the Geometry test to be available to graduate that was the reason that motivate my self to pass the test. Another difficult part of my life was when I move to this country, it was very painful because I leave all my family in my old country and all my friends that I know from my infancy, but that is not the very difficult part. when I move to this country I never though that the language would be a problem but i was wrong. Its very hard when see someone talking to you but you cant understand, its feels pretty bad. Then I start to study English to improve my pronunciation and understand better, but like I say before I never give up I keep working and I will find success. My reason for this is that I want to a better future and I know that if I speak two languages I will have a better future. My conclusion to all this would be that no matter what you have to keep the enthusiasm even if you fail many times keep working hard and youll find success.",7,7,7,6,6,7,846,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

155,2501,D2910C3C8E3B,"I agreed with Auther Ralph Waldo Emerson "" Unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" which is ture. Hard working pays you back! Some people think they become rich by nature, every time knowledge need to upgrade ,and to keep our wealthy life need to work hard. First reason, most of the time people think they become rich by nature. Which means they become well to do when they born. I personally do not support this idea because behind every success they is a hard working. For example United State of America is number one powerfull country in the world but, before America got that name their was a lots of scrifice. In my opinion If we dig the ground and we found the piece of gold that is not wealth that is a sign of destination, that means until we got the gold reservoir do not stop excavate. Second reason, when a year change lots of thing change. For instant knowledge. Now adays tecnology descover the world. In this case every time knowledge need to upgrade. If you have degree in the filed of IT in 2016 and, still you did not upgrade your knowledge you are out of the game. The system or the caricullem is change so fast so we need to ajest our speed to run with the generation. If we need to grow what we have, we need to try somthong. Inaddition, to keep our wealthy life we need to work hard. For example Bill Gate is wealthy man in America he have everything house,car and money. Bill gate does not say I have everything I do not need to work after this time. He is working hard like us. Because unless he did something to grow his wealth he will going to lose what he have. This is real life by any means if we stop trying we lose everything work, food, money, and family. The key is work hard do not Give Up. In conclusion, we need to do somthing or try our best to live our wonderfull life. I strongly support Author Ralph Waldo idea. Dreams are not somthing to wait for; they are somthing to work for. Which means works are the rode to get our dreams. Today is a great day to learn somthing new.",7,6,6,6,6,4,2921,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Telling the truth all the time would not only help people recognize me as a good person, but it will also make everyone trust me. To continue, my second reason is that I never betray someone. Never betraying someone will make people think that I am a good person, and people that didnt like me will start liking me. Never betraying someone is also a good thing because it will make you loyal, and faithfull. People that you never betrayed will like you and become your friend. Further more, my last reason about how I use this talent for good things is that I am always fair. I treat everyone the same way I want to be treated, and that will make people treat me the same way they want to be treated. I also divide things evenly, so everyone have the same amount. If you want people to treat you fair than, you have to treat them fair. In conclusion, my talent is honesty and I use it for good things like, telling the truth, never betraying, and being fair. I treat people the way I want to be treated and believe it or not they treat me the same way, so whatever talent you have use it for good things instead of bad things.",7,7,6,6,7,8,990,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

So we desisted to ask him if he wanted to sit withe us and he side ""alright I wold love to."" after that we found out we have simpler classes as him.

158,2504,510CA49B78BB,"Is setting an example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people? Sometimes it is not the best idea to mirror other peoples behavior because some people do not always have a positive behavior. There could be times that someone could be in a negative place of mind, reckless, and does a lot of horse play; other times people can be charming, properly mannered, and influential. Growing up in the Generic_City area, I have been able to witness a lot of drugs, gangs, and violence. The example these group of people decide to display is not a very positive act on their behalf; this is not a pathway you would want to be taking because of the bad outcomes from it. I remember I had a friend whos father shot himself due to the poor choice he made which made him reflect and he figured that was the only solution. On the other hand, some people decide to be very influential to society in a positive manner. Out of my three years of high school I was able to see some students making their way for others by not being selfish; a lot of them did volunteer work as well to help the community and to hopefully inspire others to do so as well. I actually got the opportunity to throw a kids halloween party at a church: I enjoyed it, it was a lot of fun. Honestly, I do not feel like I am a good example nor do I feel like I am a bad one either. I make mistakes: it is how I was taught. Growing up I believed that the only way you are ever going to learn is by making mistakes and being able to evaluate the error of your mistake; only then you can truly improve yourself and help insipre other people as well. In conclusion, I am mutual about examples being the best way to influence other people because of it not always being a positive thing due to the poor decisions some people choose to make. Truthfully I think it is a better idea to be the best you that you can be because at the end of the day there is only one of you and so many of us; it is best to stay unique.",9,9,9,9,9,9,1060,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 9"
159,2505,047BD3CB80B4,"Should students have the option to take online classes? Yes, I believe that students should have the opinion to take those online classes and that no one should take those classes away from those students. Students can be more active when they are at home then at school. You can pick a time to start your online classes and have a fixed schedule. It is important for students to have the education of there own way instead of worrying about how public/private schools are run. Most students attend to focus more when they are taking online classes; For an example, Students dont have to worry about how teachers are teaching students when they are in a class full of other students. Students tend to struggle when teachers arent teaching their students properly and care more about there monthly payments. Second example, is that having that one-on-one connection. Having that bond with your teachers are great ways to not be afraid to ask question when you dont get a problem or how to get the answers to the homework. Third example, most students tend to be antisocial at school because thats how they were born or even scared that people around them with judge the student and that the students wanna feel safe at school. My second argument is that students tend to get bullied at school; Bullying is a huge thing around the world and that bullying is a serious problem; Bullying is the number one cause of student not attending to school and not getting the proper education they need: For an example, when the student is taking an online class, they dont have to worry about other students picking on him, but instead he can feel safe and really enjoy the education that he is learning online at home. There was this one time that one of my really close friends was being made fun of and picking on him everyday at school. He would sometimes not attend to school because he was too scared to come in to class and would always worry about the other students. He would not focus on his school work, but would mostly focus about protecting himself. My Third argument is that students can ask question when they are having that one-on-one with the teacher. Students are afraid to ask a not so good questions in math, English, history, etc. Students have that nerve racking moment when a teacher tells the class if they have any questions. There was this one time that a teacher asked the class if there were any questions and none of the students raised their hands because I felt like everyone knew what they were doing in the class but me. I was having that moment that I didnt wanna waste the other students time about my question that I didnt understand on. It was the judgment that they would give me, but I know that it wasnt the case, people tend to over think about the problem inside the classrooms. For an example, Extroverts tend to not talk/socialized to people often, instead they dont talk to others and the problem that they are having trouble with and scared to ask the teacher because they feel insecure about talking or feel uncomfortable talking to others. In conclusion, Students should have the option to take an online class and enjoy learning like everyone else should. Learning is a fun thing to do, but have different learning styles in life.

Going to parks Is always fun, mostly because of the activities you do at the park to have fun. At the park you always find a fun activity to do, and people enjoy doing those fun activities because you get to play with other people, you are able to make new friends, and most of those activities can help you live a healthy life. When people go to the park the tend to do fun activities, and most of the time they play those activities with friends and or other people. And when you play those activities with someone else you can have more fun. Another good reason for playing with someone else Is you also get to talk to them.

So going to park can be enjoyed in different ways, theres a chance you might just make a new friend. Finally my last reason why people go to the park Is they can enjoy the park and the activities and also live a healthy life. You might not even notice that most of the activities we do at the park can be positive and help us with a healthy life. Its Is always a positive thing to live a healthy life you can do so much by keeping your life healthy. Thats why most people like going to the park you can have fun and be healthy at the same time.

To begin, you need to accomplish something you are struggling with in order to find your dream job. One thing you can accomplish is something that is school related. In fact, when I was in 4th grade disliked art class even when my sister said it was fun and easy I would just refuse everything that is related to art. In 5th grade as a student I was required to take art class and I thought that it would boring to be in a art class. In the middle of 5th grade I actually changed my mind about art class, sooner or later I found out that art class was something that I wanted to finish. Ever since 5th grade my mood for art class grew to be one of my likings. As a 8th grader now I am still taking art class and it is actually really enjoyable to be in art. Secondly, it will help you find your hobby and your needs. Another thing you can do to accomplish something like English class or even just school in general is trying your best. Even when you think you can just skip it, you will somehow come back to it. In fact, when I was in 6th grade my grades were As and Cs one class however was an F, that class was English class. I didnt do my homework for English class and rejected help from the English teacher. In the beginning of 7th grade that same subject was getting harder and my grade for English decreased. At the middle of marking period 3 I decided that I had to do the classwork so I can create a new habit of trying to do work. I soon found out when I was trying to complete my missing work there was one assignment that caught my eye, That assignment was a book report that was supposed to be written. I tried the book report and soon I realized that I loved writing. Lastly, completing something that is a challenge for you will help you find your strength in a certain subject and finding your strength will help you graduate. In fact, when I accomplished art class in 5th grade I found out that art was one of my strengths that was I only needed to try. I also found out that writing was something that could help me graduate and get me to my find one of my two careers. Art class helped me learn that I am actually really creative and helped me figure out that art was something that relieved my stress when it comes to school.

I agree with Emerson statement because with the individuality we can reach all our goals. It is to important for me to recognize that i have to get my goals with effort. Because this help to provide, work hard, competition, and bocome the best .Individuality is a good factor to trust in my self to be the best because help us to look for option that help our lifes .Working by my self make me work hard. when a person work by his own company he try to do a great work fixing everything it is the such as work alone, if you work alone yo going to do a perfect job to impresione others labors .For example, when i work without partner, i try to do a great gob to be one on the best workers. When i do my own work i feel excite cause, i could receive an award for be a good producer. everybody want to be award for their job so everrybody wish a reward. But to be award we have to hsave capacity in the jobs Many person due the same thing like me cause doing my the own work provide a big result. So working by my self make an emotion to work hard and to increase the amoung. Consequently to do a individual work make a good results. Doing own projects workers show more production In the factory and result good Therefore this help to get alot resources by workers. Competiton is a ways to decrease the teamwork. individual competition is a big example of overcome. Examples could be when a person start to work in his job and start to recieve more money because the person is doing a great work ,this make that others poerson get mad so in the factory start the competition cause everyone want to recieve more money and they thick is unfair be reciving the same amoung of money so they start to argued why the manager give more money to the new guy but the thing is that he has a good specialization in the job. concecuently Many time the work competition provide a good production in the factory so, everyone want to get their goals like a good amount of products also,big accomplishment occur with the worker is trying to find a new way to get more product than other. For example, when a worker finished his assignment could receive free time,this make feel angry other workers so , they are going to try to look for others forms to produce more than the winner because, they want to receive the same reward for the production . To do a good competition the work have to be alone to and with big group people. competition is a good way for individuality work to provide a emotional affect. In many companies the owners look for a way that workers produces a lot and they offer money or free time to the person that make more products .as result, being in a factory with many labors working seperated make a big impact where everyone want to procud the most materials. Therefore,challenge could be a a good idea for separated jobs . Looking for an accomplishment to become the best. Every one in this life want to have something to be recognize in this world althogh,to be a succefull person we have to work hard. Not matters what tell about us such as critique,bullying ,etc. The only thing that is important for us who we are. So the best thing that could can happens in our life is be a place where frecuently we are demand to do different things. Although with many problem we have to be patience and support all bad things. Because,if we wish to be different than the rest of persons and realize our goals. thought must be working by our selves. Because sometimes nobody is with us to provide help. fighting by my self i could be a big man in the socierity. Currently in the world we have many competition one example can be soccer,almost the majority look in the tv .Soccer is a game where a team have 24 for player. They have to compite who is the leader in the team. So like in the real life the leader is the person that work hard,help the other players .Otherwise, could be a leader in a company, to be the leader of a company ,the leader had to compite with other person that wanted to become a big leader ..Therefore to be a person succesfull have to take individual decision . Being in a world where have to take decision and concern about goals is the best thing that we can have to show our capacity. Doing my own job make me put effort and dedication. Work in gruop is affect by bet. Being a different person than others. The person that different quality could be someone that can help. Because, this kind of person make the differences in the world trying to win in a place where the competition and the demand are in high level ,so they try to have imfluences in the in their jobs. The individuaity help alot in the world to be a succesful place. For example in the govermen there are many people with a big level to compite with other this, that means it i s has a great achievement in the government,so i agree with Emerson statement cause the competition provide good benifit for us and too the progress of the government,factory,countries,therefore being a part with competiton meke us to improve our best",6,6,6,5,4,5,1742,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

That is consisting of lose ten hour per week. but those missing hour can be recoup it by extending the school day two hour and increase the time for each class per day, that is an option to increase the atention and time on each class and complete any proyect or assigment toll by your teacher, and if we get the extra two hours, we can get more time with friends and teacher for suport between us on any class someone is failing. Also, we can adopted an option for the fourth day on the extra two hours, used for time on the library, that can be amazing for the sturent who love reading, or students who love extra time on the sports, or any activity after school. The fifth day of the week can be used for doctor appoinments or any health situations, you know the great excuse for missing classes on regular school time is because the parents write a note explaining we will be absent of some periods of classes. Doing any that situation on not regular time of school will deacrese the sturent missing on any period of class. Without forget the teachers situations who are the parents at the same time and need one extra day for family time and doing regular acctivities with their sons if that they have. Dont forget the situations on seniors who are the most difficult situations on their life, decide for future, and they need time for keeping all option from universities and college for do the next step, higher education nad considered also job for weekends, also about freshman, who are the chlidren from middle school, they are the situation on needing understanding from extra activities on high school changed from their last rutine.

Considering: Only four-day school, forget about the fifth day on school (No coming a little time for five days use the full time on four days) three free days per week (use this extra time on family or friends meeting, any thing you and your parents want) No wake up on Friday mornings or may be Monday mornings (dependes on the detition of the school about which day is going to be the third free day, use time for rest and complete responsabilities) This idea can be not convenient for students with part-time job, because by following this model by extending the school day two hour will decrease the students time sheet, even though if every one on this situation can use the fifth school day that will be free for a full-time job and get three full-time job. Always remain. BE ON TWO DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES PER DAY CAN BE HARD AND EXHAUSTING, going school than going to work is exhausting because you dont have time for rest.

167,2513,E6346D434004,"It is a most important thing to be yourself. At first pass, it would seem to be obvious that you would aspire to be yourself. But we all know of the pressures to please others as we grow up. First the pressure comes from your parents, then your young peers, on to teachers and bosses. You find yourself constantly trying to live up to the expectations of others and why not? It is usually a good things to follow the wishes of those who have raised you, and it is natural to conform to the ways of people who help you along the way. it is alot like osmosis. It is also expected that prescribed pathways are followed, in a way, to repay kindness and debts. As an example, parents pay for your education, including arts and sports activities so surely it makes sense that you would try to excel in those endeavours as a form of Thank you. The same goes for showing a good teacher or mentor that you understand their lesson and often end up developing further on the path they revealed and recommended. However, at some point your own predictions and dreams emerge. Let them and pay attention to them as they will become your guide to your ultimate destiny. While showing respect for your parents and elders, start to forge your own identity. Those who truly love you will be on the sidelines cheering your every step. Consider he words of Dr. Seuss, ""Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont care. I couldnt have said it any better. Essentially, and ultimately, you dont have any choice in the decision about being yourself. Since the time of Socrates, and no doubt before, a predominant human instinct has been to know thyself. The problem for some people however is that they harbour the inner self and keep it separate from the self they display to the world. This predicament can eventually morph into a personality disorder if the gap between your inner person and public persona is too wide. Soon being in public will become a chore you will feel like a phony. you will probably end up living the life of the recluse. Not a good result for most people except the odd monk. The best way to allow your inner self, that part of you that holds your real aspirations and dreams, to become what the world sees is to start cultivating the key aspects of those chracter traits. Start becoming that person in your mind and begin to feel this is yourtrue self soon actions will follow. You will begin to feel comfortable in your own skin. For example, if you want to become a musician then slowly tell people that you ""are planning a career in music"" and start acting that way. Surprisingly, this will start you help you as other people will begin to look at you in that light. Eventually they will tell others who are interested in the same path. Soon that will led to communications between you and a host of other like-minded people. Your network will expand and you will soon be part of a musically inclined community nurtured and growing professionally all the while gaining confidence in the new you. Another way to look at finding yourself involves a more prosctive, less reflective path. Life is not about finding yourself ; Life is about creating yourself"". This is the other side of the coin. Maybe our ""selves"" are like a blank slate waiting for someone to write the future. Maybe we should not dwell too much on ourselves. Too much soul searching can lead to a sort of paralysis an inertia brought on by excessive searching for the meaning. I think we all instinctively know what we want to do it is just some of us are a little hesitant to breakout. But, it is the only way you will reduce anxiety and eventually find a sense of fulfillment. So just do it as the Nike ads encourage. Step into that real you and have some fun along the way. Be Yourself. Everyone else is taken. So, we need to keep this things into our selves that way we could improve our selves as the best human being in the world. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. So, I totally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson that ""To be yourself in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.",7,7,8,7,7,7,3325,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
168,2514,62EDBC22A953,"I think that success, are composed by failures, but not for everyone. Success are for a better life, but to have a better life there will be always complicated things(FAILURES), that may be you will want to stop doing that thing that is going to help you to succeed. The important role of failures on success is that, if you dont fail once you will not learn; failures plays that important part in success, learn is based on what you did wrong, I am saying based on wrong because If you did something wrong before, you learn that part, What do you did wrong? and next in the future you already know what you did wrong and now you will make it right. Now, sometimes we give up so easy on what we want or on what we are fighting for, some loss the enthusiasm for the success and others not, I agree with that, some think different and if you think different about the failures its going to help you to make that success. Ill say, once my aunt told me ""Believe in what you can do, and not in what you can fail on"", she hasnt never give up on what she can achieve in her life. For example Im from Generic_City and all my family are Hispanic and our home language is Spanish, and speaking English its not easy for me, but I never thought that I was going to be able to speak it. I told myself that everything its possible in life, you born for a purpose, not just because your mom wanted you to be born. There was a time, I got stress, anxiety and depression. I was failing in school and I felt so sick that I was giving up so easy and fast. Failures comes one after one, and after one, that I told myself ""You are going to be okay, and you are going to do what you like and succeed and make your parents feel proud of you"". I started to think positive, and do the things right, nothing last forever, I got rid of my depression but still with stress and anxiety, but from there to now it doesnt mean nothing for me. Failures can cause a lot of things like, feel hopeless, loss enthusiasm and giving up so easy for those who are weak, but if you are strong enough to believe that you are going to make it you will make it, you are going to have your levels of hope, enthusiasm and faith high that nothing will stop you to succeed. Failures are more challenges added to your life, to be in the top of the mountain you should hike until you can see the ocean behind the mountain. There will be more than failures, there will be big obstacles and some times people will put traps in your path. Some people will just want to see you fail in the field and some will be happy to see you in the top of the mountain. Some people fails in their path because they dont understand the meaning of the failures. In conclusion, I agree with the idea that Success consist of going from failure to failure, even if you loss your hopes or enthusiasm you got to keep going in your goal to succeed. More than 50% of people, I will guess, fight for their future they put all their effort to succeed and if they can, we can. Failures come as a good parts of success to set it down and success in life.",8,6,7,7,7,7,1291,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
169,2515,69C237AC88FF,Dear TEACHER_NAME TEACHER_NAME i agree of community service because i done it before. Its not bad and it doesnt take nothing of my time. I had to do 120 hours of community service. At first i thought it would be boring but a few days later it was fun. I had to do 120 because me and other friends did trespassing at SCHOOL_NAME. It kinda sucks because i had to go to court and my mom and dad were mad because they had to pay 200 dollars for the ticket. That wasnt cool!! Well the next day i went that same school and they told me that i couldnt be there at all! and they also said that if they see me there at that same school they would call the police on me again. Thats why you shouldnt drive fast or pass red lights because they would double the money. Now i noe not to go to that school again. But once in while i go there to say hi to the principle and the teachers i had when i was in 6 grade and when i was in 5 grade those were my best teacher ever.,5,7,6,5,5,6,1375,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 5"
170,2516,9AC838864995,"Im talking about if the school days should be extended by one and a half hours or not and the effects itll have towards the students, teachers, and the whole school together. So adding an hour and a half to a school can open a lot of opportunities to learn, more electives, and what most students would think of a longer day at school is bordem, but school is where you socialize the most during the day and as a kid school is where you meet most of your long time friends so there is more then just being bored at school its a place you can socialize, have fun, and learn all in one day. If it were up to me whether to leave the school schedule as it is or to add an hour and half to the school day I would have to disagree because if the teachers were to give piles of homework then when you get home youd be exhausted and drained to the point where you arent able to then even if you did manage to then you would be so tired that it would effect the next day which would cause you to barely do any work in school so the students need to get out of school so they can get their homework done. If students were to stay at school till 4pm assuming there bedtime is around 9pm then the would basically only have 5 hours to do their homework but wait so then imagine if they had chores to do around the house then once theyve done their chores theyd be even more exhausted so after all that they had done what if they wanted to relax a little bit now they have such little time to do anything during their time off from school that they might have to stay up longer then they usually do now its about 6am in the morning after last night they could barely get a goods night rest and their body and mind are completely drained for today and all they have is good breakfast to get their mind to at least keep them knowledgeable for the day and this whole cycle repeats over and over but then you can at least get a good weekend of relaxing so that youll be refreshed for the weekdays. I disagree with the decision to extend the school day because of the effects that it has towards students and how it can effect their mind and how much productivity they are able to produce could be affected due to overwhelming amount of work put upon a child. There are definitely many pros to having a good education and to be able to live a good life. Students may not want to go to school and can find it very overwhelming but at the same time the students are working very hard so they can have the best possible life they can. School is a place where you go to learn, have fun, and the school has provided the time so that students can learn what they want by having electives that they like the best because that what they might want to be when they grow up because if the school didnt have such excellent teachers the students could never succeed on their own and thats why the teachers have to relate to the student so they can have a much better understanding so that they can proceed to adulthood where their decisions can affect them badly.

The reasons why, are so students can learn what our community needs, how to make our community better place, and why is community important for students to know. Its a great to have a community center to know how we can make things better. Students think community center takes their time away. but they have to learn what our community needs. students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! students will present their list of things our community needs! due to that students will be giving extra credit for the ones who have low grades! Some students dont participate because their friends say its waste of time. it would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. students should know that the program is about our own lives, because if our community is bad well our lives are going to be bad. due to that students will want to participate and will want to make our community a better place for us. some student might say why is the community important anyways, were fine nothing is wrong. but when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important. students will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it. so principal the community center will be a great place for students to learn lots of things. so i guess this will be a good idea for our school. students will learn what our community needs, how to make our community a better place, and why is our community important!

173,2519,68392F53B9D7,"I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best because not everyone always learns from their mistakes,the problem may have already affected them,the way to be successful in life is to hardly have any mistakes. I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because not everyone learns from there mistakes. some people cannot remember if they had a mistake a long time ago and that mistake comes up again, for example, my brother had failed his drivers test and when he took it again he failed again. Furthermore, when your nervous and you had a problem, Some people get trauma and they think of that problem and they are afraid of doing it again, For example, I missed a tackle at football once and I was scared of doing it again, so when I had the chance of doing it again I thought about if i would miss it like last time. I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because the problem may have had already affected them so they would not be able to change it. some people may have made a really big mistake so they would not be able to be the best if they have had that chance. For example, somebody on the news had the death penalty for murder so they would not be able to change that. Furthermore, people have had the opportunity to get something great but they chose not to, they cannot go back and change that. for example my sister got this award but she refused to take it so she cant go back. I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best because the way to be successful in life is to hardly have any mistakes. A lot of people had had many mistakes in their life and failed to achieve their goal, for example, my cousin wanted to be a lawyer but then had a lot of problems with what she was doing so she quit law school. when people have a lot of mistakes they tend to get more mistakes and then they end up trying to figure out how to deal with all them. for example, I was taking a test and I tried to figure out some of the questions at once but then I ended up mixing all of them up. In conclusion,I disagree with the quote ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because not everybody can acknowledge what do do after they have made a mistake, the problem may have already have had a negative impact on them already, And the way to be great is to rarely have any mistakes",7,7,8,8,8,7,1356,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
174,2520,07C6BB6ADA38,"One topic that is frequently debated today is schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would be benefit to student or not. Some people believe school should offer this program for students that need time for their morning routine. They feel that it would help students for do not need to have to wake up early and go to school. I believe distance learning program that school offer for students would not be benefit to students because students will not have a skill to communicate with other people, it will make students have less enthusiasm, and some students family did not have no internet or device to watch the video online teaching. One reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because it would make student get less skill from communicate with other people. When students go to school they will meet friends have a communication with each other or talk to their teacher. Communication is an important for every type of jobs. Communication is one of the most important thing that should have inside the lesson because every job or every company will hiring people that have good skill to communication with other people. Communication is almost every where inside the school but if school have to consent to have the distance learning program, it will affect to student to get a job by taking students away from their communication with other people. Another reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because it will make students have less enthusiasm to learn. Every morning students have to wake up early and get ready for school is one of the practice thing that will let student get ready for outside the world. Enthusiasm is one of the most thing that will help students to have more responsibility to their job or their self. Lack of the enthusiasm will make students have a lack of responsibility to their job or their self. However, if school consent the distance program it will make student get a lack of the enthusiasm and it will make students get lack of the responsibly to take care even them self. Final reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because some students did not have device or Internet at home to watch the online or video conferencing. There are many family that did not have the Internet at home and they will not be able to attend the classes at home and will not be able to watch the online or video conferencing. It will not be fair to the outer family that do not have a internet or device to get into the online or video conference to the family that have the internet or device to use. Therefore, school should not consent the distance learning program to make all the students equally. As you have read, I believe distance learning program that school offer to students would not be benefit to students and affect to students by take students to the bad position. School is the learning place for students to get a knowledge. If we are going to have only the online teaching, school will not exist. Only when we value the learning in class, communicating with friends, and being equal with other we will feel that school is a good place for studying and getting the knowledge.

176,2522,CDE661A599F5,"Imagine the president and the government of our country being nothing but idle and letting the country run on its own. There would be no regulation in the country. The history would repeat itself and many of the tragic historical events that happened in the past would happen again. We talk about the American Dream a lot but being lazy and just waiting for something to happen will not take us anywhere. As Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"", I agree that if we always do something we accomplish more. We as human beings have so much potentials in us but we will never discover it through inactive. Firstly, I believe that inventions and new discoveries have made people more lazy and inactive. I dont blame Inventions and discoveries because they were made with good intentions and not through idle ism but there are people who trust inventions more then they have to. There is always something to do in this world; we accomplish more when we aim higher. Even small chores prepare us for something big. laziness is a big wooden door which can only open by ourselves and once we open that door, theres always something big waiting to happen and once we accomplish that another big adventure awaits. In the history of United States, there were many people who idolized idle. We had a government who let the country run free, this had a great impact to the country. the country was poor, people died because of huger, disease etc but now the country has accomplished so much then the people in our past would have imagined. The country is well know all over the world now. The country has accomplished by establishing government regulation which removed all the laziness from the country. If a whole country can accomplish so much from not being lazy then imagine what a person can accomplish. I believe there are people who supports on being idle more that have to do work. I agree that it is okay to not do anytime sometimes because everyone needs a break in their lives. There are people who believe in not having to go outside their house because they have all the technologies or they think they have nothing to do. Technologies serve their own purpose but we have our own purpose, we are born to do something big. If we could just go out and just help one person and day, that person would help another and another to another, this would be such a great accomplishment.

177,2523,F2A721819364,"Generic_Name 3/8/2020 Dear, Mr Generic_Name. I am a student who is in attendance at your high school, writhing to you about the changing of our school menu. I for one think its a grate idea to change our school menu into a much healthier one. Our current school menu has its redeeming qualities, but it also has a few lose ends. For example; they serve things like pizza, burgers, rice with chicken, nachos, spaghetti, Pb&j , and salad. Do you see the problem with the food items listed above? 99% of the schools menu contain high levels of fat and carbohydrates, which is not a proper meal for a growing student, or any human being. I remember seeing posters like the food pyramid, posted on the lunch room walls of my middle and elementary schools, but not once did the school lunches follow that expatiation. This is the problem with the school menus all over America today, they serve fatty foods filled with carbohydrates and not enough protein, fibers, and good fats. As growing students, we need food thatll give us energy through out the day, and keep us focused in our classes, but the current menu isnt serving us the food we need; dont get me wrong, they have things like fruits, vegetables, and other good side options, but thats not enough. We need the main meal/ main dish to be the most healthiest thing on our trays, not the side dishes. The students at our school may be disappointed with the sudden change in the school menu, but theyll just have to adjust to a healthier menu. Itll be nice if the school menu items was a bit more healthier, but the side options must stay the same. The side options our school menu currently have are just fine; they meet the expatiations of a healthy side option; the offer fruits vegetables and the occasional desert. The health of your students and my peers are important, and a big part of being healthy starts with what you put in your body, so please continue with the plan of changing the school menu, our future selfs will deeply appreciate it. Thank you for our time. Sensually, Generic_Name.",6,6,7,7,7,7,3593,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
178,2524,B8656754E9EB,"Do you believe failure could lead up to a better person? Shortly, I am going to discuss as to why making mistakes is necessary for a person to become a better human being. When a person makes mistake hes/shes is more likely to learn from its mistake. However, not all person learn from their mistakes in the first time, some take longer than others. Therefore, you should always look back at what you did wrong and always fix your mistakes. Making right decisions should help you become a better human being for its future community, country, and even the world. I personally strongly agree with Churchills statement. A person should not always be right, some people think that by doing what pleases them they are doing good. However, little do they know theyre hurting people because they decide whats good for them and whats not good for them. That leads up to a person who is selfish, mean, and has a cold heart. Mistakes are a problem, and problems can always be fixed. Once upon a time my friend Generic_Name had a girlfriend, Generic_Name. He was a good kid with a good heart, therefore, that led to people takeover him easily. Generic_Names girlfriend or friend would always takeover Generic_Name. She would tell him what to do and how to do it, she was the man in the relationship. Thats how good my friends heart was. She knew she could trust Generic_Name because Generic_Name loved her like he never loved anyone else. Till the day came, sooner than what we expected. The day that he will never forget. It was a Thursday and Me and my friend Generic_Name were on our way to work, I was driving when all of the sudden he starts screaming like if he was having some sort of a seizure. "" NO how could you do this to me"" he said. ""What happened?"" I asked. He tells me that he was on snap chat just chatting and looking at snaps when all of the sudden he sees his ""girlfriend kissing another man. I tell him to relax and to let it go that she was not worth his time. He calms down, breaks up with her and moves on. Years passed, I noticed that he has changed. He is not the sweet boy with the good heart anymore. He now learned from the mistake he did, which was to let his girlfriend controlled him. He now knows when to say NO and when to say YES. People make mistakes all of the time in their lives. However, that does not mean you cannot change it or fix the mistake you did. Mistakes are mistakes. You cannot go back in time, but you can move on and make a change in your life. In conclusion, a better person makes a better future for its world. People can change,and we all make mistakes. However, we shall learn for the better. In Conclusion, I would like to give an advice to all people to never give up. You made a mistake? You all shall learn from it. Fix it. Make of yourself a better self being and be and example for all others. We are not perfect, but we could try or at least act like we can be. Learn from what you did wrong an improve yourself.

179,2525,BBE8AE3B2B09,"- Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years? In my opinion it is not a good idea because the normal time to be in school and the normal and traditional years to spend in high school is four years. Graduating early is not a bad idea but neither is a good idea, why? because some students need to learn more before graduating. In school you just dont learn math or English, for example you also learn: How to save up money for a better future How to have a better behavior You learn how to spell some stuff correctly How to write essays There is a lot that you must know before graduating. Most of these stuff you learn in high school, and yes it might be a possibility that you can just learn all of that in three years by doing extra tests maybe staying after school, extra work, and not having any elective classes. Most of the teenagers would love to graduate a year early but doing all that stuff its a lot of stress, maybe instead of enjoying the weekends with your friends or family you just stay home finishing work from school. Some teenagers also have a job after school and doing extra work not spending time with your family nor friends can stress you a lot take a lot of time and yeah it could be worth it but what if you dont pass any of those classes or you do but graduate without even knowing whats the difference between a debit card and a credit card. In my opinion graduating early should not even be allowed because for example i have this one friend that is doing that and taking extra classes, she doesnt have any elective classes, on the weekends she doesnt go out nor spends time with her family, every time i see her instead of seeing her happy i see her stressed and tired, because she works and comes to school but shes most likely graduating this year and that something that you should be proud of, thats something that is going to help you a lot in a future and you can also start saving up money earlier than you thought, but in a future when you look back and remember your high school moments you wont have cute or fun moments to remember all you will remember is ow hard you used to work to get there and how many times you missed maybe a family dinner or a family reunion or a friends sleepover. Graduating early is actually good because you can have a better future but graduating early wont let you enjoy your life right now that we are young. Honestly i thought about graduating early one time and i told one of my friends and all he said was "" If you know you wont regret it in a future go ahead"" that got to my head a lot because this age that we are in now, is only once there wont be no other chance to go back and be 17 years old again, and to enjoy your parents and the time that you have with them right now.

I want to learn how to start my own restaurant , know how you manage the prices , how to run the business , and also how to manage people. However, I work at a restaurant at the moment and I am trying to become a manager. Although, I heard you have to do a lot before you become one . I want to know how to run the prices and how to make deals because I dont have that much experience , and must know how to do that to become a manager. Furthermore, I researched your job and read the reviews your customers love your restaurant . They say it is not to expensive but not too cheap ,also they say it is worth a drive down their. Thats why I wanted to ask to if i could get some experience from you. Moreover, I wanted to know how to actually learn how to run the entire business. For instance, if i wanted to open up my own business I want knowledge from an expert before I do. My school does not have the right experience that you have . Also, I had spoke to one of my classmates they told me that you do training classes for students that are very interested in business she applied and she told me that she got really far in her business and that she is already getting started. I wanted to apply for the training so I have a clue on what is going on so I can eventually start my own restaurant. Lastly, I wanted to know how to manage people around , know how to be a right trainer for a perfect restaurant. Nevertheless, people say it is hard opening up a business if you dont have the right training . For example, I had a friend that decided to run a business without experience she did not know how to mange the line in the kitchen , the people in the front, nor the prices. Later on the business ran out of service and got shut down. However, that is not how I want to end my career . I want to go somewhere and be in a place where people will love to socialize with the waiters, and to get their orders right .Thats an important part on why I came today to experience the way of training. Based on this talk, I want to start my own business and work on becoming a better trainer . Even though, I have no experience with running my own business, managing the people, and how to manage the prices . I hope by the end of today I can get applied and start my training so I can get some ideas on how to do things around a restaurant and start my own business by 18 years of age.

As i know some students really need to graduated early some of them need, to help their parents with some money. Its a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college early. Some districts are offering programs for students ; for example they are allowing them to graduated in three years some students need to help their parents with some money. Also they want to graduate early because of college this programs really help students and high school. Students who follow all this plans they have to be persistent to graduate in three years. To illustrated students wants this programs to be able to have the things that they want ; for example buy a car buy some clothes. Also students enjoy to hang out with friends so if they graduated early, they will work and have some money to buy what do they want. Students must follow all this plans to see the results. While some people think that its a good idea for students to finish high school and three years to enter college early, others argue that students dont learn enough in three years. There are severals ideas that improve this such as they didnt focus in learn more about assessments. people think that they dont learn enough in three years, they missed classes that they might need in the future; for example construction class we dont know if one day we are going to work in construction then we will need some skills in that job . Also advanced PE we are going to needed it for our healthy students need to know more about other classes that they might need it in the future. I think its a perfect idea for the students who wants to get a diploma in three years. Students need to work to help their parents for example pay the bills and all that. Also students wants to work the year that they have off to save some money for college.

We meet new cultures by others student who are in our group. We start to learn know his culture and what they believe. We start to learn about they language and how they communicate in their language too. Also the food and the music from their country. Meet new persons from others countrys is good so that way we start to know more about the world. We learn how to communicate with others person not only our language in others to. We start to talk with new persons. We start to share things from our culture and what like to do and our free times. We start work together and getting better by communicating.

This can improve human society in many ways by making life more easy, even kids nowadays are using different sources to find something fun to do or watch for example on the platform YouTube kids can find toys reviews or cartoons which its fine but thats also keeping them from playing outside. There are a lot of problems in society now days one of them is ciber bullying, this can drive to many problems some people take it too seriously and that can start an argument,and some people can feel offended for other people opinions this can cause a big impact in those who are really sensitive in fact there are many cases when this drives them to commit suicide, for unlimited reason people get bullied everyday but its our decisions how you can take the respond. The best way to avoid ciber bullying is by not paying attention to whatever the other person has to say and walk away, focus on yourself and dont look back thats how life works.

Some people have not figure out what they want to do in their life. It is always up to yourself to make life choices and some people like to listen to other people ideas but not listen to themselves. Humans like to listen to their friends or family members ideas too see if they can help them out. I think people like to listen to others people ideas but their own idea which is showing they can not make their choices by themselves. Many of the humans depend on their friends or family being their to help them out. Being part of this life is learning how to make choices by yourselves and going out in the world and making yourselves an adult. Kids that turn sixteen start looking for jobs so they can grow and see how the money and dealing with customers works. When I turn sixteens years old I went out to look for jobs i wanted that feeling where I could earn money. People would make fun of me for working at a thrift store. At that time I cared what people would say about me and I told my manger that the job was not for me. I would listen to people comments but it was not worth it because they are not going to be there in the future. The point is we let people make our choices when we can do it ourselves but we like to depend on others. Some people can feel like the world make their choices. Someone who you do not know about can judge you for no reason. Some people feel like they have to make everyone happy but not make themselves happy. When it comes on choosing who will be our next president not a lot of people like to tell others who they will vote for because there is always a person who will say something about it. There was a time when I was in my government class and a student asked what i thought about our president and his issues. I told him how i felt and instead of telling that he agreeing with me he told me how wrong I am and I did not know anything about the issues and how the president is trying to slow it. It can always be a person who you do not know trying to make your choices. Even though sometimes we make our mistakes however I feel like we depend on others When it comes to make out choice we like to learn from experience we been through. We like too watch other people do it or we like to do it ourselves. I think it happened too be before when I thought I was doing it the right way and I would look around my classroom and I would see the other students doing it differently. By the end of the class the teacher got all of us in trouble because we did it the wrong. I should have asked the teacher or kept doing how I was doing it before.

190,2536,D948703E8026,"Should the city council adoption the curfew of a 10 p. m weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers? You often hear people say that teenagers are costing more problem to other people and for the around them environment. The city council should adoption the 10 p. m midnight curfew for teenagers because teens would stay out of problems, and they would have more time to do school work. To start, the curfew would avoid teenagers being in problem with the law. For example,teens with the curfew would not be in gangs or cost problem to others. Lets say that teens had the curfew it would expand beyond the level of doing good to others and staying out of gangs or doing bad stuff. They would be able to achieve their goals fast and force on what is next in life. Even though, this curfew sounds bad its not bad because teens would learn that the curfew is just to help them and help the environment around them. Secondly, the curfew would allow teens with more time on their schools work and have time to force on their work. For example, teens would have more time to focus on their schools work than being on the streets with gangs. With that being said teens would have a chance of achieving their dreams and being successful in live without a bad influences. In this scenario, it show that a curfew is not bad because it has some good way in live and it allow people to do good stuff for others. Ultimately, with this curfew it allows young people to see the better side in life and it would help them to stay focus in schools by achieving their work and doing the right things. Some people may say that having a curfew is unfairly interfere in young people lives. For example, young people have the right to choose the way they want to be. Therefor, being later in night dose not meant that young people are doing bad stuff or their are in gangs also they are just having fun in their way. Thus, being in a curfew it show young people that their are controlling by other people just because they have a different way of having fun. In this scenario, it show that having a curfew is just unfairly for teenagers just because other teens got in trouble it dose not means that all of the young people needs to have a curfew. In conclusion, the city council would just being helpful to the young people by add a time limit. And it would help the environment around them and it would give more time and focus to the young people. All in all, it is a good thing to put a curfew because teens would have more time to spent with their family and doing good stuff for the environment.

192,2538,076262AA0CD5,"The Curfews Keep Teenagers Out Of Trouble Once, I walked down the empty street during midnight. Then, I heard a rising sound of a strange footstep behind me. Suddenly, I felt anxious and scared that someone might come up to me and murder me for money. Lucikly, there was nothing happened to me. After I got home, I had a thinking that what if a city council adopts a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is published, any teenager who is wandering on the street after those hours would be violating the law. On the other hand, some might believe that the curfews unfairly interfere in young peoples lives because it does not let the teenagers have their freedom and accomplish something that is very important to them, which they cannot do it another time. I still agree with the idea that curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because it stops teenagers from doing something that is illegal during the late hours, it moderates them to be a better humans being with molarity without having any criminal records, and it prevents young people from being kidnapped or killed at night. Some people argue that curfews should not be publish because it limits the freedom of most teenagers. Still, I believe that curfews should be establish to put an end on any illegal act that is commited by teenagers because the young people should be controlled by laws when most of them are not mature enough. They should be strictly managed instead of being free and are allowed to do whatever they want. For example, teenagers who hangout with their friends at night and get drunk are more likely to do something that is breaking the law when they are not sober enough. These young people tend to pull out their weapons to threat others who walk outside at night for money in order to buy illegal drugs. This is an important issue to pay attention on because these teenagers already become the worst humans being when they are not strictly managed by anyone or any law. However, they will keep threatenting others when the curfews arent carried out to prevent them from doing their vicious things. In fact, there are several criminal cases that are committed by teenagers in America, which proves that the U.S. government is weak at controling their citizens and managing the society within the nation. This fact shows that the U.S. government does not care about the moral of young citizens and the safety of all citizens in general. The U.S. government should carry out curfews that keep all teenagers in control in order to limit any illegal acts. The estalishment of curfews is important because it shapes all teenagers to become the better people who has morality instead of threatening others to get what makes them feel pleasure. The curfews should be carrried out to moderate all teenagers into better people who treats others in the right way because it helps them stay out of any trouble that might be an unfortunate consequense in their future. It shapes their morals and erases all their bad behaviors that makes others feel unpleasure. For example, teenagers who turn out to be good people when they have parents who do not let them go out when the sky turns dark. Also, their parents strictly manage them and prevent them from going outside at night to do illegal things. However, some might believe that the curfews do a little improvement on teenagers because they still sneak out of their houses without their parents awakeness to do what they like at night. This is an important issue to focus on because these teenagers will turn into adults who have several criminal records that might bother them from getting their jobs in the future. Moreover, teenagers should be more mature to realize that any violation acts that they had done will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Therefore, if the curfews is adopted then they should be obey to this law in order to avoid any unfortunate results that can occur in their lives. In fact, many companies prefer to choose employees with a good moral because they did not commit any crime in the past, which proves that they will not cause any danger while working in the companies. Unfortuantely, people who had done any crime or violated any law in the past will more likely to stay unemployed because they are considered to be dangerous. The curfews is brought out to protect all teenagerss future from being damaged by any of their wrongful commitment. The curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because most of them would not want to be kidnapped or murdered while walking on the street at night. To prevent any harmful cause that can happen to young people, the U.S. government should set up curfews for teenagers. In fact, there are many unfortunate cases of missing teenagers in America. This fact proves that numerous teenagers had been kidnapped while they wander around empty public places at night. In this case, the U.S. government should adopt curfews law because it can decrease the act of kidnapping teenagers. However, some teenagers are killed while they are going out at night because there are a lot of robbers appear during this time. To solve this problem, the U.S government should let the city council bring out the curfews law, which can restricts all teenagers from going out at night and protect them from being murdered. In conclusion, curfews law is significant because it can reduce the criminal acts within a society. It shapes the society to be more organized and less dangerous to the citizens. The curfews can keep teenagers out of trouble because it restricts teenagers from committing any unfortunate crime. It helps teenagers to become better individuals in society who treat others in a correct way. Specially, teenagers can avoid death and being kidnapped when they obey to the curfews and stay home at night. Lastly, we should set up curfews and believe that it can protect all teenagers from getting trouble because they are going to be the one who runs the planet one day.",8,9,9,9,9,9,99,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
193,2539,43EE2C3C7EB5,"Have you ever wondered why teachers encourage working in groups? working in a group is far more beneficial, as you get to achieve faster, work productively, as well as learn how to work together with people, and sometimes, people you dont get along with. Working in a group can help bring in more thoughts, and bigger ideas, therefore i recommend we start working in groups over working alone. Groups help you get things done faster, as you divide up the work between the members, more things are done at once, for example; while I write up an essay about a project, someone else can design the project! Working in groups can be more thoughtful, while the group discusses the project or work, they are able to combine thoughts and think of more ideas and make the work thoughtful. Groups are also very fun! Have you ever had to work alone and just wasted your time staring at the clock go ""tik tok tik tok"", because of how boring things are going? In groups you are able to talk to friends and discuss the project as you go along and work with people you like. Working in groups result in a better job done, as students get to divide the work based off what their good at, helps them make the project or work better. Students in groups are able to help each other by correcting each other mistakes they are also able to teach their group mates things they dont know as well as share ideas and thoughts together to improve the work or project being made. Often times I see students struggle but once in group they are always there to help each other improve and that is why working in groups is helpful. It may be argued that students could possibly not get along together in groups, however, once students are forced to work together, they are also forced to get along to achieve and succeed. Something to keep in mind is that in the future, students might have to work with people they dont like, but have to get along with in order to succeed in their job and thats why we should prepare students and teach them to get alone with people. For example; Ive had times where i had to work with people that i didnt get along with, but throughout the project we had to work together productively in order to succeed and get a good grade, and since that project we are now best friends. After all, the decision is yours but I will encourage you to start assigning groups for projects, as it will help get things productively done with less time, and it will also teach students to get along with each other, create friends, and learn how to work as a team. Working in a group is much more beneficial and should start taking place more often.",8,8,8,8,7,8,882,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Since i started to be more positive in my life, everything was looking better, i found the job that i wanted, i bought my first car, and, me and my family move to a new house, overall everything was looking better. Based on my experience people should be positive and be around positive people, listen to positive music and found activities that incorporate positive attitude. People should find new friends that give good vibes and help them become a better person, because sometimes the problem might not be themselves , might be people thats around you telling bad stuff, and always making you a have a bad day. Changing the music that you listen to, could help you be more positive, because most of the songs and artists that most people listen to these days, sign about, drugs, killing people, gang related stuff, and thats good if you want to be positive.

196,2542,3766B7A3A5E0,"There are many different ways to look at this statement. Even though Mr Lubbock does make an excellent point in his argument I do not support it. I believe that our characteristic traits have a lot to do with the people that we choose to surround ourselves with. We have all been influenced in a certain way by someone. Whether if that was being convinced into doing something that we didnt want to do or if it we were given a confidence boost to tackle the challenge ahead of us. There have been many cases where someone gets into a lot of trouble by doing something that they didnt want to do. They were brainwashed into doing what everyone around them told them to do because they were the people who they truly trusted. But in the end they where just let down by them. For example there are many known cases where some innocent teenager gets a drug addiction because they were influenced to do them by the people who they were surrounding themselves with. This one poor decision has now changed that persons entire life by someone who they probably wont even remember their name in ten years. They wont get the opportunity to play in any sports teams because of their current state. People will look down on them because of what they have done in the past. They wont get the same job opportunities as other people because of their mental and physical state. Because of this we should be able to love ourselves the way we are and we shouldnt need the influence of people around us to shape our lives, we should be forward and honest with people, if you dont want to do something they that are telling you to do you need to build up your confidence and tell them that you wont get involved in such a thing. Does this mean that you will loose a couple friendships? Sure but at least you did what was right and you were able to take control over your life and make what you think are the right decisions. Now that person is probably going to get into a lot of trouble by what they have done but you wont because you were able to take matter into your own hands and do what was right for your future. In conclusion take control over your own life and dont do what everyone tells you to do. Go with your instinct and if you believe that something is wrong then dont do it because it might change your future for ever for the better or for the worst.

The phrase that Duke Ellington said is a good phrase and i totally agree with it because the problem you have or that you will get is a chance for you to do you best at fixing it or solving because the problem will give you a chance to do your best unlike if you come across a problem of just get a problem and you dont try to fix it or dont care or sit back and just watch your problems just pile up and then problems just come and come one after another then you have more then one problem and its just better if you do good on your first problem and you fix an if its big problem and you over come it at the end you will feel great like Duke Ellington he is now legend at jazz music and you know t is not easy to get were he got to be called a legend at jazz music and on his way to the top to become a legend all ways remembered every were you go for he had to over come lots of problems the hate the way he was going to play jazz were he would play his jazz to start up who could give him a boost or help with the jazz to be known more around him were he would get more new instruments money for a place to keep all his music how would he sell his music and all those problems he had to over come and fix and he still made it to his dream and know he is legend. In conclusion when there is a problem its good to do your best at it or any problem even if you have more then one problem just over come because in the end it will turn out to be a happy ending.

200,2546,5DD1954E47A8,"How old were you when you decided what you wanted to do for a living? Some schools are requiring students to choose their career before entering high school, witch shouldnt be done. Although it is understandable that students know witch career path they would like to take to start preparing early. Students should not be choosing their careers at a young age as they are to young and inexperienced with the world, should be more focused on enjoying their childhood and lastly should work up slowly to decide what they would like to be when they grow up. Students before high school are to young to choose a career path, as they most likely do not have much responsibilities. For example a child with little experience on responsibility might choose a career that requires you to be very responsible. The child with little experience on responsibility will quickly be stressed and overwhelmed and will most likely under preform. An older student will have more responsibilities and will have more experience, most likely will choose a career that will be a better fit for them and require responsibilities they are comfortable handling. Young students shouldnt be extremely focused on what career path they want to take. They should be more focused on enjoying their childhood. By engaging in extracurricular activities such as: sports, music, reading and acting. By participating hobbies they enjoy being a part of. The students will explore and experience more witch will help them as they get older in choosing what they like and what they would like to do for living by simply having fun. As we only have one childhood and we shall enjoy it while it last. A way of introducing careers to young students without making them commit to a specific one. Is having classes in schools that teach a specific career such as: construction, engineering, agriculture and law enforcement. By providing classes like this to children they will be open to explore new things without committing to one career. Slowly introducing different careers to students by having extra classes. Is a good way for them to start thinking about their future without making them choose one specific career. Overall students at a young age should not be choosing their careers. It its way to much stress for a child. They are way too inexperienced in responsibility. Should be focused on enjoying their childhood. Introducing different careers at a young age without making them commit is helpful way. This will slowly introduce them to different careers without making them commit to one and risk stressing them out. In conclusion students will wait till their time comes in high school and they will select their career path from there.

201,2547,45A86623B659,"Do you agree or disagree about the importance of attitude? I agree with the importance of attitude, because with your atitude you can motivate yourself to do the best in your life, and you can motivate other people to do the best in their life. Some people think that in this life your positive attitude is the key to do good in everything, because if you go to any place, job, or to the school with positive attitude your life its going to be excellent. In this life the success is the key, because if people have negative attitude in everywhere, they just dont want to nothig. For example, if they go to the school/collage with negative attitude, maybe they dont want to learn new things about the class, because they are going to be mad, and they dont want to do work with negative attitude, but if the people go with positive attitude they can learn averything they want, or learn more than they know about the class, because be positive means that you want be success in your life, also means that people want to do the best in everything. Second, people can do better in this life with positive attitude, because they want be graduated from collage wih positive attitude, and with them positive attituted they maybe motive to other people to do the same thing, with their positive attitude they learn more, they are going to do work, homework, and classwork, because in this life the key is the attituded, that means everything you do, do with positive attitute,if you do that you are going to learn new things easy. Some people argue that in this life you dont need positive attitude, because they only think if you pay attention, do homework, and finish classwork in the school/ collage so you can be success in this life, they only think about to be responsible with their works, not about to have positive attitude. People also argue that in the works you dont need positive attitude, because the only thing you need is experience, work, and be resposible. In conclusion, if you do everything with positive attitude we can learn things more easy, and you are going to be success in this life, because you motivate yourself to do the best, also you can motivate people to do the same thing, to be success in this life, with positive attituded you can do everything, because you want to learn new things in this life.",6,5,5,6,4,5,908,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
202,2548,39492CE9549E,"Teachers can justify students knowledge more accurately than students. Teachers are very experienced compare to the students because they gained so much knowledge in their life. By doing the teacher designed projects, students can learn something that they did not know about. Teachers would know what topics they really need to focus on and what are the most important things they need to know about. Students summer projects should be designed by their teachers to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break. Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being effective during the summer break. Teachers know the academic ability of their student because they know how the students answers some specific types of questions, they know how the students think and understand. For Example, In my fifth grade there was a math teacher named Generic_Name. Ms. Generic_Name and I spent so much time with each other to discuss my mistakes on a test, She asked me do to test corrections on a paper. I solved all the questions correctly without a time limit, She came to me and said, ""I knew you could do it, because I have seen you working very hard these days"". Then, I realized that I knew how to solve these problems but I was scared to complete the test before the timer goes off because I did not know I could complete everything. This examples describes that the teachers know our academic ups and downs than ourselves. They also know what we need to learn to succeed in our class, So when they design a project to their students they make sure that the students are going to be effective on their break and learning something new which will help them in their future. Summer projects of the students should be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are hardworking even during the summer break. Teachers know the capacity of hard work we do in our class, they observe the amount of effort that we put into different things like talking, reading, writing and singing, etc. For example, one of my teacher in 10th grade was really nice to me, she always used to ask me about my hobbies and interests. I had a presentation in her class and I went to ask her for help the day before the presentation because I was preparing for almost a month, I wanted to ask her if I did any mistakes in the slides. After I showed her my slides, she gave me a big hug an said ""I know how hard you worked for this presentation, I gave you a hard project to see is you are capable to do it or not. Even though you came to United States two months ago, you did a fantastic job"". I was very happy to hear her saying that I did good and on the day of my presentation I felt really confident on my work. This example explains how the teacher knew that I worked so hard to do my best. By assigning me a hard project based on my level of understanding, I worked hard to understand and analyze every single detail. That helped me to gain confidence on my self and my level of hard work improved a lot. When teachers design the project they make sure that the students are trying to work hard and they want to see how your working level is improving. Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being responsible for their work during the summer break. when teachers design the project they know how long it is going to take the students to complete the project and how well focused and responsible a student need to be while doing this project. For example, My history teacher in 10 grade was very strict, she always wanted our whole class to turn in everything that she posted online in one day. After 2-3 months of struggling in her class, everything was going really good till the last day of that academic year. All of my work was completed on time. This example says that even though I worked really hard in the beginning, when it came to the end of the year I was really happy for being responsible for my own work. By learning how to be responsible from that teacher, helped me a lot in all of my other classes too. Summer projects given by our teachers can make us feel responsible for ourselves, by doing the projects teach us how to be focused and concentrated to get them done on time. when the students design the project they take it easy because most of the students just pick something they already know or they already feel confident on, which will not make them feel responsible. Teachers are very experienced to know how students think about something, they can understand what students know and what we do not know academically. They always try to teach us how to build our academic skills. They want the students to be in an amazing position, they always want to see the best from us because they know how the student are. Summer projects of the students should be teacher designed to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break.

In many schools districts offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. This program make students to take classes that can help them to graduate on time, and many student take courses during the summers or in the evening. This is a bad idea making students to finish high school in three years. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school. First, when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course. For example, many students are interesting in elective courses, but they not got enough time to taking elective courses because they are take the basic courses for they can graduate on time. When students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting. In conclusion, students need four years in high school for they can take courses where they are interesting and they can start to grow up in that courses. Secondly, student are not joy in they last year of high school. For example, school where are make student to graduate in three years, in they last year student have to take courses and SOL for they can graduate on time, if they dont past students most retake, and this make students frustrate.

In other hand, there are people say, student just need three year in high school, for student can enter college or the work one year early. They argument, that student with three year are ready to graduate and enter college or the work, because many student may finish with their courses and SOL in their third year and the last year they dont do nothing. This argument is incorrect because in the four year students are doing what they need to finish and they planing where they wants to go if college or work. For example, students want to graduate on time, and they need to catch up or retake anything they can do it in the last year.

Example of staying out of trouble is you can get mistaken at night; and get hurt just by not going home at the right time. Another example a teenager can be at there friends house and if they leave late or outside with there friend, anybody can be outside and would want to hurt them or there friend because its dark out, but if you have the 10 pm curfew you can leave without worrying about being in trouble. also can have a guardian to pick you up when its late so this scenario would not happen.

If you do not have enough sleep, but can have the 10 pm curfew to help you to get some rest and will also help you concentrate in school. An example for this is a teenager could be outside and they do not have a curfew so the teenager comes home late. And does not get good sleep or no sleep and goes to school tired and cant concentrate. A good counter claim for both is you can just stay home and dont have worry about a curfew or going home really late. because if you are scared to go home late or cant get some rest just stay home. You will be more safe home with a guardian or sibling then outside in the dark and not knowing who is outside. And parents should just be more protective so they dont end up going home late. And they can stay home and sleep earlier and get lots of rest for school. with both arguments i think the best for teenager is that they should have a curfew just for safety reasons. And no parents should be worried or scared for there kids being outside late because there city council do not have a curfew. And another reason is they can get good sleep for teenagers is very helpful for them so they can have a lot of energy and concentrate in class better and get good grades.",5,6,6,6,6,7,1730,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

There for it will be not always the case between how other view your things and traits makes you in insecure how other people see you and you change to make your self better than our parents gave us something we just got it from society like there is a lot of influences in the internet and more things that can go far behind the imaginable and they are not controlled by anyone they are just more likely to have more influences beyond there control but there is a lot of influences in this world you just got to find the right one for you and stick with it general likely there is more change in society for different perspectives. Secondly there is a possible out come that you everyone can get out of this, just like other people that change there perspective at looking at things there for i should say that i have changed a lot since i got here in Virginia and am adapting to being normal well the normal way of being normal for other people there are influences beyond our control because what you see on the internet you will want to mimic it one day like there is a lot of rapers talking about girls, god there is a it of are influences in our daily lives always hearing what a rapper did or what type of things he is going to do there for its a bit concerning about all that because for a person that just moved here is a lot of change there is a lot of people that influence almost all the world in California there is where i lived all the artist and musical players and all of them have a purpose of having more people being influenced by them and making a lot of money if they get a lot of attention from a lot of people. There is kids just like adults that get influence by others there is a possibility that we choose our own ideas of being influenced that are out of our control we choose to be this way we choose our path always they follow what we want there for i am proud of the world we live in. There is a posibility that new things come out every year new things that kill us or maybe other things like war and most of the things happening to our world and more polution and more virus that want to kill us and it is being more influenced by others to be scared of it becasuse you could die from that there is a lot of thinnking behind every smart influences.

The work in group is more better then work alone, in the beneficial is the student work in group is have more opportunity of learn more with other students in the class, they can work more better and understand more quickly the theme in the class and have more collaboration, learn to respect other students. They in the group can say new ideas for the team. I think in the personal the work in group is more productivity in the student because have a good communication with the students and teacher, they have more positive attitude in the ideas and participation. For example, students in the group work more and learn more quickly because in group have a higher quality of ideas, and students can change ideas together about the theme in the class and have a better determination in the job of the class. Second, work in group have a big benefit in the class because students understand problems more quickly, and they have solution in theme complicated with ideas and dedication in class. Third, students have collaboration with other students have a good relation and learn to respect others person for religion or ideas. They have more communication in the class and have more better grade in the school. However, work alone not have good result because almost all the student have fear to say ideas for the critic of other students in the class, and they have slow work in the class for complication of the theme. The preference is work with a group have more benefit in the student and teacher to learn and teach other students in the school have more communication, better work and good relation in the school. sincerely Generic_Name ",6,5,6,5,4,5,3652,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Students also finish their homework and get a good grades on it. Staying afterschool can encourage students to try harder on homework and school work as well. Staying for homework club can also make students to be more productive then going home and not getting homework done. The homework club isnt just beneficial for students but as well as for teachers. Teachers can see questions that many students had a hard time on and then go over it. teachers find it useful to see questoions many students have a hard tim on so that they can practice. Teachers feel good about students finishing their homework and understanding the subject better.

217,2563,C97C2190DB65,"Imagine someone asking another person wheither they should go to a friends party or to the movies, but he or she told them something like, ""Its up to you to decide, not me"". That person eventually agrees; but when they finally decide on wheither to go to the party or to the movies at the last minuate, they end up missing out on both. Sometimes, making decisions on your own can be pretty tough and frustrating, but it helps you become more independent and you do not have to relay on other peoples decisions. People can not depend on other people for what they think all the time. It shows that instead of being progressive with their work or anything else theyre doing, that person can not make up their minds or is just being lazy and is always looking for someone elses opinions instead of their own. This also shows that they are not self-reliant or progressive like how most people usually are. Making our own decisions also means following our own intincts. For example, a group of teenagers are planning to skip school to got the beach for the entire day. They try to convince two other of their classmates to join them, but they told them no and that they are going to get in trouble for missing out on their classes. Trusting our intincts can be very helpful when it comes to things like skipping school, alcohol, or even having sex with someone. It can maybe even save your life or someone elses in the future. It also helps people become more independent on their own. People can not always depend on their parents for the rest of their lives, they will have to move out of the home they grow up in to start looking for jobs and earning to support themselves. Another example is when a teenager starts appling for colleges that they want to go once they graduate from high school. They probably have been told that college will help them get ready for when they are ready to get a full-time job (which also has to be something they want to do for a long period of time), pay taxes and bills for when they have a house or apartment to live in, and maybe even take care of their familes. People should make their own decisions because they can not always depend on other peoples opinions, they should follow their own intincts that can probably save their lives one day, and it helps them become more independent to get ready for the future.

However in this world there will be someone that will disagree with your opinion, because they have different type of mentality,or they think in a different way. If you have a goal you never need to stop growing on it, becasue is something that you really want for your future and you want to do that for the rest of your life.

In overall if someone is trying to talk to you about their past experiences you should pay close attention because it could come handy in life.

For example if you encounter the same situation as them youll know what to do,in the other hand if you didnt pay attention to them and you face the same situation they did youll be clueless on what to do. If a friend is in trouble or he needs advice with something you could help them out because of others past experiences. Another reason why it could be important to listen to someones past experiences is so you dont make the same mistakes as them. When I was 8 years old my grandpa used to tell me that smoking wasnt good at all even tho he did it all the time,then my dad told me the same thing about smoking so Ill always know that smoking its not good for anyones health and I wont make the same mistake my grandpa did.

In my opinion you should try new things and not be stock in what you already mastered because ,You can learn new things, You can grow as a individual and as a community and You can help others. When you try new things we learn because the make us grow, for example if you want to open a buisness of finances in your community but you do not know how because you never try to do it you ask someone that have already mastered of doing it and you can start doing your buisness because you already try and you learn how to do it. another example would be going to college and there is a class that you already know because you take it in high school and you explain the thing to your friend and you are a mastered doing it and one of you friends ask you for another class problem but you do not because you haven try the class but it sound interesting and you want to try it because you want to learn new thing and try not matter what your situation is in your life be confident of your self. other example would be try to cook and learn your self that can teach you that you can try by your self and learn by your self but you try and that what it matter you try. Try new thing help you learn and learn help you grow as an individual and as a community for example you grow as an individual because you take the class that you friend ask you before and you did it answer him because you haven even try then you try and become a mastered doing it and you open a buisness the community start growing and you open more buisness you become more important and the community grow more as well as you and you became someone important for the community and you keep having chance to be better every time that you learn you start helping people that do not have a chance to imprube them self. an for teach your self of cooking is a motivation to other to try the same thing. You can help people when you grow because you learn how to do the work and now you teach the work to other to they can have a better chance in life giving them a place to work and having them grow as well the community grow because the buisness that you open people was more interesting in your buisness and they make you offers and tell you to work with them but you are scared that you work may not work but you remember that if you do not try and stay of what you are mastered you would not grow. cooking your self help the community to have people to get in head and teach others.

I will give three reason and examples about why I think working alone is better than working with a group. To follow at what my brain tells to me is the best decision I can ever do. I remember one time when I was in middle school, I was working with a group of five students. That day the teacher told us to make a surprise to the children with cancer. I had an idea to make a letter and a big poster with some illustrations to make those children happy, but we didnt because my partners didnt want to make the poster and we only did the letter. thats why I always believe that is better to work alone. In my English class, the other day teacher made some groups, and each group had to make an essay about the contamination of earth. I was in a group of four, I was trying to do my best by reading a book about earth and what causes earth get pollution, when one of my partners stopped me by removing the book that I had, that made me really angry, and now that makes me over thinking that working alone is one of the best choice that one person can make. I remember the last year here at Generic_School, Generic_Name my health teacher told the class to make some groups for presentations about drugs and its diseases that these can cause. And also, each group have to pick their topic about what are you going to present she said. I asked her if I could make the presentation by myself and she told me that I can, but it may be difficult for you because it is hard to explain in front all your partners she said. I did my presentation about the alcohol, and she congratulated me because the hard work that I did. She told me that she was glad about me because I did the best presentation from the class. Thats why I always prefer to work alone, so no body can interrupts what I think. In conclusion, these years really changed my point of view because now I think that working alone is one of the best choices that a human can make because it makes a person over think and believe more in their self.

226,2572,B312F104B015,"I agree that the option the some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says ""distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing"". I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you Some benefits that students will have being in this program are the food and transportation. Lets say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. Another thing is the food. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want. The benefits that you get does not end there. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that. Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you. There still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. Like for example lets say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. Taking classes at home take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do. Concluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways. By taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job.

227,2573,6253F73FBABF,"As my opinion i disagree because ""you could be someone beyond the world"" if you are positive of yourself. you could take a risk of many things you want to do in life and become something wonderful of it. you can graduate and became someone you wanted to, thats growing masterly of no matter how many times you have try but where has got you. Be a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again. If you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them. In life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it. be someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person. Making good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things. Dont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because there really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. If you want to be a great person dont thought of yourself you know you could do it you could grow of it other people would love so any wonder things and person you really are. being positive of your self is the most amazing thing you could do like for example you could be positive and just be like i will pass a test or i will pass but you are just being positive that you are sure you could do it because not you only are positive of yourself you are also showing that you could believe that you can do it. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. Unless you really dont try at all you will never grow even if you have put your best effort your best part you will grow and become a person that others are just going to admiral you. could you really learn from life yes!! you can be aware of it but hey!! we are not perfect nobody was born perfect we can make as many mistakes we can or we could be the greats but no theres nobody perfect that could tell you that you cant do something when you know more then anybody else that you can and that you are not perfect. It doesnt matter how people make you feel at the end of the day it would only be you and your family and the effort to put on the things you want to become the best not perfect but the best. Sometimes is just matter of time for you to really tell yourself that you could try your hardest and not give because life is not about just being a completely fail nope you could tell youself you can do it because you got it.

228,2574,E8485EFFC9A2,"The outdoor activities parks, get people to know each other better. The activities outside is fun, because you get to meet new people, where there is always competition and competitors. The main thing what makes an activity fun, is the enthusiasm of the people, having an enjoyable moment. However, how people or siblings cheered for you and others for the other team, is sensational. In Conclusion thats what makes a game great, the fact that has many memorable moments, that you will never forget. In general, activities exercises your body, ounce you get use to running ,or playing sports. Techniqually, you wanna do more when you really like the activity that your doing, thats enthusiam for a motivation. Then, you definitely wanna be the best at it and there is others, that have the same interests like you. So, theres people that are gonna get across your way, because their unstoppable like you. Since, a child they liked activities that motivated and inspired them, to be good at, eventually this two big starts find each other and there both nemesis. So, lets say your motivation was only getting a scholarship, by sports, and the goal, that you propose to yourself, eventually you completed it. Supponsendly after 30 years your in national TV playing the finals cup worldwide, for your team, thats were imagination can take you from a winner to a star. It starts from just playing with friends, finding encouragement from siblings. Then just practicing and from there is your decision were you wanna take yourself. Along the way, you can become a successful professional player, like Messi,Lebron James,Usain bolt,etc. However, thats the main point goal for others, but nesecerally you dont have to be good or the best at a sport. Certainly, if you participate on activities is good, because your showing potential as your age grows. Also your forming you body in general, which makes you stay fit, fresh, and always hydrated which is good for your health. Everybody starts from going from different clubs and parks, where you could start going from your community. Then the state and then national parks, provide you greater opportunities and thats were the journey begins. I like to think that activities generally sports develop your body in a sort of way, that it can also develop your brain into knowing more knowledge of that sport and knowing every detail of it. Neseceraily, not only physical effects can happen to your typical common general body muscles, but having an understanding of the game can be outstanding which requires critical thinking that can affect your organ brain in a good way . If you get to see chess not considered really a sport ,but an activity that exercises your mental thinking, others find this game or other games interesting too and really find the complexity of the game and thats how legends form in any type of game. The community and people are starting to know each other better by Community activities along everywhere State communities, and National communities. If you asked people that do activities everyday, they will say almost everyone in the world, ounce upon a while everyone did a activity. Since, is what forms your bodys growth, shape,and knowledge. The main thing is that there is activities for everyone, that everyone can be good at something and they can have a good time, on what theyre doing.",7,6,7,5,8,6,3365,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

230,2576,7A552DBA7D71,"The effects of allowing students to have and use cellphones in the classroom is not listening to what the teacher has to say, not using it property for your educational purposes, and disturbing the class from learning. The students with not pay attention to what the teacher, because they are so busy in their cellphones. Some students decide not to use it for educational purposes and uses it for other purposes. Using cellphones in class will also disturb other from learning, because they are so in to their cellphone. These are the reasons how using cellphones in class can effect them from learning. First, you will not be able to learn if you are using your cellphone in the class. Using your cellphone in class may get you off task and u would not know what u learn today in class. Some days u would be mad and take it out on other, because of what you heard on your cellphone. Overtime your cellphone vibrate you always going to want to see what it is and that will have your attention. You will not be able to focus like you use to with our education and be on your cellphone at the same time. Second, using your cellphone for other purposes can not help you learn what you need to learn. If you do not use your cellphone for educational purposes you would not know noting from school to know about. You can get in some problem for not using it for education. They should not have it out unless the teacher say you can for your assignment. This is why people should not use cellphones in school for these purposes. Thirdly, people will disturb other people from trying to learn with there devices that can cause a disruption. The cellphones will ring and stop everyone from learning, because they will pay attention on whose phone is ringing. You will not be able to know how to do the work if do not know what to do. you are disturbing your classmates that are trying to learn the material they need so they can do something with there lives. You should not disturb your classmates from being successful in life. As you can see, the effect of having a cellphone in class while you are trying to learn to be successful. You should not be ignoring what your teacher has to has to you and your classmates. The use of the cellular device can only be use for education and not other purposes. Last but not least, do not make your classmates fell just because you do not want to successful does not mean your classmates do.

232,2578,68685615FE0C,"There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like ""can I use the restroom?"", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes. Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is ""Generic_Name"". In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher. Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying. In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.

What if student had to take art but they dont like it? They would not try the work and just fail the class. What about drama class,not everyone enjoys it so it shouldnt be required. Not every student wants to sing or play an instrument. Therefore they shouldnt be forced to take a music class. Although it would be great for some student not all would like those classes.

234,2580,E4905D0DD050,"Working with a group would be much easy because you have less work to do by yourself also you would finish it faster. In my opinion doing it in a group is helpful by having less work for yourself. For example, doing all the work on your own would take much longer and probably wont do it right. Also Ive done projects on my own and it takes a lot of time and a lot of effort to finish it and turn it on time. Needing a group would be helpful not just for me but for everyone who is in it because by doing together we would all get a good grade. Being in a group would make make everything much easier for everyone. Doing your project wont take as longer no more because we would do it in groups. For example, doing your stuff takes to long when doing it yourself . As in doing it all together it would be much faster. Everyone would take a part to do of the project and put it all together. In a group everyone would put a part of there assignment they have done to pull in the whole project together. There was this one time we all got to pick are group to this big project about the earth we all got a part we want to do. We had to full weeks to turn it in but because we all did want was assignment to us we finish in a week and turned it in and got ""A"" for our project. In for all doing it in group would be much faster. I think by doing it in a group it really helps because you get to know your classmate more. For example, you can get to know them by talking to each other. By getting to know your its a good thing yall can all become good friends and do even more project later on. Its also good way to comutate with others in your class you havent talk to. This one time by math teacher made us to get into groups but I didnt know anyone in the class but, a girl invite me to go with hers and I did ever since that we are always in the same group together and she became my best friend.

235,2581,ACABA85B131B,"Dear Manager, Did u know that many schools do not have local companies and organization that allow students to explore certain profession? I believe that they should have local companies and organization because when work as a teacher, the teacher can help students, have fun with students, and solve problems. When you work as a teacher, the teacher can help you with anything. Like for example: When you are stuck with any of your assignment ,or doing a project, the teacher can help you with any of your assignment, or a project. However, some teachers do not help with students because the students wont get it, or learn anything. When a student needs help, go ask the teacher for help because when u dont ask, then you wont get help by the teacher. And that it is important to ask the teacher for help because when u ask for help, the teacher wont help you because you didnt ask for help. When you work as a teacher, it needs to be fun because the student can not be bored and that they need to do fun activity like for example: Like going outside and play fun activity playing educational games that contain subjects like Math, Science, Reading, or History ,or like playing Soccer,Football, and Basketball and do more fun so that the students can not be bored. And that it is important to have fun and instead of being bored and not doing anything in school. When you work as a teacher, the teacher need to solve problems. Because a student might have bad situation, or might have a ruff day. And so the teacher needs to talk to the student whos having a bad day. Like for example: If a student is having a bad day or a bad situation, the student need to ask the teacher to help with this situation or a problem that u have that is going on. And that it is important because the teacher can help you with anything. Teachers are important because they can solve problems that u have or question that you have so you can tell the teacher about it. And that the students need to tell the truth because when your lying, the teacher wont help you and your getting yourself in trouble, and making your situation more harder and more difficult to yourself. Therefore, working as a teacher is important because the teacher can help students, have fun with the students, and solving situation or a problem. And it is important to work as a teacher, at the same time it is hard to handle with the students. Consequently, a teacher can handle anything, or any problem that you have, or having a ruff day and you need to talk with someone, or a teacher.

236,2582,545E9BF477C1,the reason i think that we should not have more school time is because some people in school would not be able to keep up with other kids. and most kids get ttired of being in school for six hours imagine being in school for longer then that and even more kids would start going to sleep in school. because they are already tired of all the classes during the day. with another good reason that i disagree with adding more time in school is because some people have to do things after school like take care of family or go somewhere important and if you added more time then they would not be able to do get this stuff done because they would be stuck in school learning longer then the time they are accually supposed to get out. i belaive that there should not add more time to school because it would also be a waste of time because teachers would have to do even more stuff done buy more stuff for students and get more work done grade more papers because we would have a longer school time and then the teachers would have to write more speak more and do stuff more then they would if we had only six hours in a day. with another reason that i dont thing school should not be longer is that it would not only affect the students and the teachers but it would affect everyone because then the whole school board would have to do more work and the school would loose a lot of money because the school board would have to buy more stuff for students and get more things that kids would need to get everything set up good for the students. with another good reason we should not have longer school cause if we had longer time kids would not be able to handle so much because they would be learning so many thing in one day and then it would confuse them and when they are going to take a test they would be confused because they were pressured to learn so much in a short period of time and they would not like that because they might fail. ,8,5,7,6,7,6,1099,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 8"
237,2583,856351253492,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now. First, it doesnt matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member. I dont think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i dont think you could get taller then you already are. The only thing that can change is your body what i mean is if you chubby, over weight you can do excuse so you can have your body the you once wanted to have. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. But like i always say ""Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself."" Second, I dont think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and dont you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter. I think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller. Dont you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson. In the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could ive been taller by now. I dont like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right. So that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples. This goes to the person that readys my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life. On this one i have tried my really best so you could understand me what am talking about.

240,2586,C1E9D98B3613,"I personally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson with his quote saying ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" The reason i agree is because I believe that you have to set your goals higher, if mastered something already. Its always alright to fail trying to master your goal because nobody is perfect. You also need to try different goals to master so youre good at several things. The first reason why i believe you should set your goal higher, if you have already mastered your goal is because if you keep doing the same thing youve done over and over and have already done great at it, you will not see any growth in you. For example if i was in a soccer team and played for a rec team. Which rec is when you sign up and get put on a team with no tryouts. If i played and score almost every game and always outplayed my opponents. I wouldnt grow as a soccer player because the opponents would be easy for me and wouldnt be a challenge so i would have to set my goal higher. For a higher goal i would have to move up to travel to see growth in me and have a challenge in the game. I believe that people also disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because they are scared to set there goal higher when they have already mastered it. The reason i think this is because they are embarrassed to fail and not do something right. When im reaching a goal of mine like getting three goals in the net in a soccer game. I work hard to try to accomplish my goal so i can master it and score three goals every single game. Sometimes i fail and dont score three goals but i always tell my self its alright because when youre reaching a goal you will fail at least once or probably more then once. Which makes me work harder. Nobody is perfect and always a good thing to fail to learn about your mistakes. The last reason why i agree is because you have to try to master different things in life. Sticking with the same thing you mastered will just not make you good at anything else. Its always great to have different things youre good at because you can do a lot of other things. If you dont like any of the goals you want to master and cant reach it. Its always great to have other ones along the other one youre trying to reach because i know a lot of people change their thoughts and want to do more then one goal at a time. You have to set your goals higher if mastered something so you can see growth in yourself. When setting your goals higher you will fail at least once, you shouldnt worry because it makes you learn about your mistakes and so you wont do what you did to make you fail. Also you have to try different things to master to be good at several things in life. This is why i agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote he wrote.

241,2587,AB7823891008,"I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. My first response is some children can commit to a career at a young age, if they want to improve and they want a good future, they have to go to school and many of children can helped from their parents. For example; if someone want a career at young age they have to work hard, and pay attention, some time is going to be difficult for them but they can do it. Children engage in a career at a young age to prepare themselves for their future . Also, is a good idea for students to a career at a young age because they are improve in a good age and they thinking about their future, but in a career at young age some children want to graduated at a young age, first they have to work hard at school, and there are many way, and programs to be graduated from Hig School for a career at a young age. In conclusion, kids who take advantage of programs, and High Schools, are qualifying these students for their lives ahead in order to have a good future with a career they want. I definitely think that programs make a positive input in these helping young life. ",5,6,5,5,5,5,2296,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Some students want to take a career during they study but some students dont wanted to thinking about any career when they study in the school. First, for example people want to know what do you want when you study if you think is more import ants to take a career when you study, and you are young most students know that is more important because you think about you future, and you want to try to progress you life maybe for give your parents a better life when they can to help you because they are older for work. Secondly, we have many people in the world want to progress in his life because they think is more better for the future have a better life with your family, but is more important to know what do you know what career do you wants for progress your life because we have many career in the world that you progress better some students like to take a career more difficult like technology, teacher, technical and polices but any career progress your life. However, students dont want to know what they want for his future because they thinking I was in the school I am young, and is the reason when they dont want to take a career during the students is study, but I think is important to think your future a career for helping your parents maybe your uncle, sister, brother, but we have many students they want to go to the school for have friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, and dont progress his life many people have problems about drug, drink, and fight. In conclusion, I agree with this position to take a career before you graduate because is more easy to know want do you want to know what career you are interesting for progress your life is better know before that after because you have a career, and your mind have this position to take a career for better life maybe when you almost done you have what career you have for making money, and try to help your family in your life",6,6,6,6,5,6,2944,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

I certanly agree that everyone is capeable of choosing their own character trait, they are independent enough to have control over themselves, theyre capeable to choose in what type of enviroment they want to be in, or how to react to bad or good circumtances, at the end of the day we all have the freedom to choose who, and what we want to be. Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. everyone have the completly control over themselves, no matter how bad the circumtances may be or how tough a problem is, everyone will always be allow to choose either to smile or cry, to be positivee or negative for example; My grandma, shes a 78 years old lady that have work her entire life, shes a very independent women who always says, ""If i dont do it, no one can make it as good as i can."" Always with a positive attitude, never sitting down, because she says that sitting down is a waste of time, and she have always been so energetic, until one day that sadly she had a really strong stroke in the middle of her brain that made her lose movement on half of her body, and her voice, her doctor told us that she was going to stay in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, it was hard to see someone so positive and with so much energy, in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, everyone was really shock and depressed about it including my mom, but even though my grandma knew what was going on her positive attitude never change, she took over the circumstances and she never gave up on herself she decided to be ""positive"", even though it was a rough time in life, this example helped me to see that everyone have their own control or they can choose who they want to be in the hard or easy times. Everyone can have the freedom to choose the enviroment around them, how they wanna live, with who they wanna leave, people have the abilitly to understand when there are toxic people around them, to understand how much an enviroment can change the way they act, to understand that they can change the negative enviroment into a positive enviroment, everything in your character depends on your onw person, yes the enviroment that is around you can affect a lot on your character, affects on what you do in a daily base, but at the end of the day it alwasy depends on you, who you wanna be, who the people around you should make you feel, and how positive or negative it should be. Having a reaction with other people around you can show them what your character is, it can show people your weakest part, and can shows them how dangerous or calm you can be, reactions are a really big part of our characters either if we have the control of them or not, how we react and how we respond depends on us, for a lot of people having their own character its really hard, because of their negative or positive mood, sometimes we want to be or act like other people that we see at school, but thats like stealing their characters, at least but not last everyone have the freedom to choose what their character traits are or can be. In conclusion everyone is free to choose what they character should be, no matter if they are going through a rough time or have the whole word agains them, theywill always have the chance of trying to be someone else character or build their own, but it will alwaysbe what they choose their character traits to be.

Despite the fact that technology gives negative effects it actually gives positive effects as well. We use technology everyday it is a part of our life. Technology helps us in many ways for example our jobs, many of our jobs involve technology and the use of it helps us get our job done succesfully and easier. We use technology to commuincate for exanple a cell phone is used to communicate with other people this helps us know where people are if needed or just to see how they are doing. We use technology in school for example computers, cell phones, these devices help students on their everyday assigments it helps them use the internet when needed and it helps teacher with their teaching as well. Technology causes a distraction. For example cell phones are used every day in schools cell phones distract students from their learning and their peers around them also. While using these moblie devices when not asked to students grades go down and they dont show interest in school anymore. These cell phones are not only a distraction they are an addiction to people. Another example driving while using your cell phone, this can cause a distraction and that can lead to a car crash. Some people are texting while driving or playing music and even the gps is a distraction because you are looking down at the gps instead of keeping your eyes on the road. This shows us distraction can make you loose focus or not pay attention your surrondings. Cell phones can cause less contact with other people. When using your cell phone you dont look up while walking you just keep your head down this is usually the case with teenagers and kids. Teenagers dont interact with parents, peers and family memebers anymore becasue of these moblie devices. These devices can cause people to not have interaction skills for example people dont know how to approached some one if talked to. This show us that with this technology we are loosing our social skill we dont even know how to say hi to someone anymore it is very sad what technology is doing to us it is stripping us away from the world. Despite the fact that some say technology has a positive effects it actually has a negative effect. Technology is part of the human life we cant take it way anymore.

I disagree because it can be very tiring to stay school more longer, it can change your mood of being in school, and you may want to got out with friends or family. The First reason, Is because if we stay more longer in school you are gonna get more tired. If you get tired in school you are not gonna have more energy to go outside and entertain yourself. And you would just go home and sleep all day long. However, if we dont extend the school hours, we wont be as tired, and we would have energy to go outside. The Second reason, Is that if we stay longer in school it can change the way you are. Staying in school longer can change your mood because you wont be as happy. Because you would have to stay in school longer. Also you might have teachers you dont really like and you would have to see them longer. However, it doesnt have to be that way, if we dont extend the school hours. The Final reason, Is that you woudnt have time to spend with your friends or family.

As for me, I am strongly disagree with this idea because summer is the time for student to visit their famiy, their relatives, to do whatever they like, to enjoy whatever they love and sometimes learning too much might be somthing that some students could not handle. First of all, summer is the time for students to come back to their hometown to visit their family. Some students, like me, came from another country so a lot of times we do miss our hometown. That is why having a three month summer break is truly a huge chance for us because that is pretty much the only reunion we have in a year. I will take mine as an example. To be able to come back to Generic_City it is not just about time, sometimes it could involve money. The ticket is just too expensive, not to mention that it is in summer. So if I can visit my family this year, I might have to wait a few years later to be able to visit them again. Secondly, this is a period of time where students can do whatever thay want to do like doing some volunteering or club activities or playing sports or just simply doing their favorite hobbies. If we shorten the summer break, students will easily get bored when they come back to school because they do not have enough time to do what they like in summer. Nobody wants to study when they are bored. So if we want a student to return to school with lots of energy, we need to let them have a break. And that give me an example. One of my Vietnamese friend told me that even in summer he still have to take a lot of tutor classes. That is why if we shorten the summer break then lots and lots of Asian students will not even have time to do what they love! Last but not least, learning too much might be something that some students could not handle. A short summer break meaning we have to go to school more than we need. I know that if we shorten the summer break we will have a longer winter break, but that is not the case for the country that does not have a winter break or a week off in fall and spring. A student could get stress if they do not have a proper break. Just check some examples on the news or internet, especially in South Korea or Japan. A lot of students suicide just because of learning too much. Too many homeworks and tests, pressures from parents and teacher,.... Very stressful! Not to mention that Asian students usually have a shorter summer break and winter break. On the whole, I am not agree with this idea and along with fact that I am an Asian and I used to go through a very strict and tough education in Asia, I can never accept this.

Some students already know what they want for their future life and doing this activities they are enriching their educational experiences and getting ready for what they want to do for their future, so in this possition shools should not control this envolment on this activites instead they have bad grades, missing classes or being absent to school. for example my friend Generic_Name likes technology and he is taking an academic class and to take that class he needs to go to another school but luckly his main school gives him the opportunty to take him to the another school, and he already know that this class will help him on his career and his taking care of his grades and at the same time taking care about his academic class. Now there are other students that are doing this activiteis and they are nnot totaly about what they are doing and they are forgetting about their shool.

For some students this is a big privilege. Find out who they are. A few of this students are not really insterested in this opportunities. They tend to think that is useless just because they dont have the program they are insterested in. Normally people get use to the things they like, and they dont want to learn new things. Sometimes is hard to see that learning about new things could give huge benefits. Other students realize that it could be fun to learn about new things. If they are lucky enough they could find the career they like. When kids start to go to school teachers always ask them to think about what they want to be when they grow up. Almost everyone wants to be a policeman, a fireman, a teacher, or a doctor. When they grow up their way of thinking chances. Kids realize that there are a lot of other things that they could like. While others grow with the same mentality. Some of them make it happen, but some others change their mind in the way. It does not only happens when they are little. It could happen when they grow up, so they should give it a try to new things. It might be better than it looks. Also, If they find the program they like and try it out they might find out if they truly like it. I had a friend, and he really loved psychology. He took the class this year because he thought it could be interesting. Midway through the year he found out that he is not so good at it. Although it was too late to back up he realized that psychology was not what he was looking for. Sometimes people believe they have what they want and that there is nothing that could stop it. They all should have a second plan in case plan A is not working so well. Everyone should be ready just incase there is a rush change, and they have to take a decision in less than a day. They have to hope the best and get ready for the worst. Some students think this opportunity is lame for not having what they want to learn about. Some others see that there are a lot of benefits in it and go for it. I classify myself as the kind of student that takes new chances. I also have two careers in mind.

Rarely students really want to learn, or to feel like they need to go to the college or university, cause they have a few time to go to the high school. This idea is great and amazing to someone really dream and feel that the high school is the door to the college, university, or opportunity to do your dreams real. The advantage is if you finish high school in three years you have more probability to go to the college or university. The disadvantage is that three years would be very stressing and harding time, because you need really to focus in the high school and all that stuff like: homework, worksheet, project, study, or simple attention the class. The good news is you can do anything if you have purpose, if you have motivation and completely focus in your dreams and What do you really want to be or to do?. Do not worry is you feel fear that is normal everybody feel like that about the test, high school, or dreams. I think is a big opportunity to me; well, I work and really need pass my last year, but sometime feel like ""I cant anymore"", and I want to leave or run of the high school and just work, and work, and work, but everytime I think like that just say me "" NEVER GIVE UP "", always remember everything I did, why am i here?,and How too far wil be go for my dreams?. Sometime the life is very unjust, cause some people have the opportunity of study withouth work, While others people do not have chooses, and that is the situation where the hispanic people live today. Well, that its my point and why I am agree with this awesome idea. I have been thinking this system or program will be helpfull and better for every student that the system we have today. My view is if you finish the high school in three years, will be more effective, easy, and fast to be gratuated. Thank you for your attention.

258,2604,883C1EF358F6,"At some point in every ones life,There is a time to be self reliant. People should make there own decisions, Because, As a self reliant person, making a decision based on someone elses advise can be very risky. For example, buying an insurance plan, going based in someone elses coverage will cover something you dont need, while if chosen based on your needs there wouldnt be a problem. Self reliance is very important for person to become independent. If one dose not trust themselves how will they grow. for example, A famous quote by Micheal Jordan says ""You miss 100% of the shots you dont take"". this quote eludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self confidence in their decision making, because if you dont take a risk in making your own decision you will 100% miss the shots you take. Furthermore Making os own decisions are important ,because, People will not always be there, and you will be forced to make your own decisions. For example choosing your own apartment isnt anybodies elses job but yours. Choosing an apartment is very important and one must have self reliance in order to make the right decision for them selves. In conclusion being self reliant is the most important skill you could have, while, I could see the other side saying that going to an expert is the best way to make a tough decision while that may be true, they will not always be there for you.",7,6,7,7,5,5,1809,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Generic_City park its located in Pennsylvania and is one of the places I would like to go there with my family. One of the reasons is because there are great attractions, like roller coasters and games. One thing I would like to see as soon as I arrive is the Chocolate factory and the Lazy river that is in the Aquatic park. As I said before, ""There are awesome attractions in Generic_City park"" let me talk to you about this amazing roller coaster I would love to ride and the name of that roller coaster is The Super dooper looper. The Super dooper looper is one of the greatest roller coasters and the reason is because this roller coaster has more loops then the other attractions and one of the loops is super big. But thats just the beginning, there is also one section in Generic_City park that I would like to go too, and is the area where all the video games are and you can win tickets every time you win a game. You can win prizes with those tickets and you can also buy food near that place. I also said that I wanted to see the chocolate factory. The chocolate factory shows you the process of how they make that delicious chocolate, you can see everything there, from the beginning to the end, that is one of the best places I would love to go because you cant only see how they make chocolate, you can also buy it and feel the taste of the best chocolate ever Kisses. The chocolate kisses is one of my favorite chocolates thats why I would like to see the chocolate factory. The aquatic park its the best place to not feel to hot when is super sunny outside.

The lazy river is one of all the attraction I would like to go. The fun part is that in the lazy river is that you can talk with your friends, and enjoy the journey after a long and fun day. And thats is one of the places that I would like to go and maybe you will like to go, because Generic_City Park is a fun place where you can have fun with your family and friends, and have an amazing and unforgettable day, with so much adventures and fun.",7,6,6,6,8,7,1903,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
260,2606,2DE38160D46B,"I dont believe school should follow in businesses footsteps and do the four-day school week. I believe that school should stick with the five-day school week. Because it would be better for the students in the long run. If school keep the five-day school week there would be a lot of benefits with that. like if students have five-day school week there would be so much free time for students to do whatever they want like take care of responsibility, after school clubs, homework, study. And free time is way more useful to students. Now some can argue saying that if school had four-day school week they would have more time because they would have a extra day off of school. And that true but there a catch with that it only one extra day off like say if you were in a club and you meet on Thursday then you would have to show up to the club later because school was longer now of course im using that as an example. So if school did have the four-day school week then yes you would have a extra day but like I said before there would be a catch to it. Now even im not going to lie and say that five-day school week is the greatest thing they have there. They do have there down fall. Like for starter we have five days where we have to show up to school. And also school is long on enough with the five-day school week. So yea... five-day school week do suck too. In conclusion, I believe that school should keep five-day school week and not the four-day school week. As I believe that it is better for students in the long run.

Some people think that are impossible to change, because they had been said or think that you cannot change your first impression, when you at first meet or start knowing someone, that is not true because clearly you can change your first impression, even though it can be the same or different as the first impression you had at the beginning of everything, but you may also be insecure or confuse of your own thoughts and feelings. I am in disagreement with this prompt that it has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, because just imagine clearly your first impression it may not be the same when at first you start knowing someone, when at first you meet someone, or even when at first you look someone by the first time, people may also said that is impossible to assume your first impression at someone, because your perspective of someone may be different from another perspectives of others, you may have the same perspective or also different from other people. The day when at first came to United States it was really hard for me and for my family from Mexico, I was really nervous and also a little scared, it was one of my dreams that became real, I was so impressed and surprised of everything, the first impression that I used to have of United States changed, now that I am living in United States, the impression is different because now I know how is to live in a different country. Not always is going to be how you thought it would be, but it can be even better, even thought your impression was different or was the same at the beginning. The day I came to this school Generic_School, my impression from when I meet my counselor Generic_Name were different from my impression after I meet her, I thought she was going to be really mad and mean counselor or I even thought she was going to be a counselor that doesnt like Hispanic people, but all my thoughts were wrong, my impression was really wrong because my thoughts about her were wrong, now that I know how is my counselor, my first impression and perspective changed from the one that I used to have and believe. In conclusion, as the end of this prompt that it has been first impressions are almost impossible to change is wrong, that is not believable because your first impressions and your own thoughts can be wrong, even though you thought it was going to be something at the end is not how you thought it was going to be, first impressions are possible to change because they can be wrong even though your perspective can be true, or it can be also wrong. Dont let first impressions to trick you because they may be wrong, you can change them if you want, but make sure to be secure.

262,2608,80E36876B2CB,"No more junk food in the cafeteria anymore. Students need to start eating healthy, and take care of themselves so they can stay energetic for the rest of the day. Cafeteria needs to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some of the students favorite cafeteria foods. Its a good idea to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu because students will eat more healthy, students will not be obese, and they will be healthy instead getting sick every other day. Majority of the people who eat healthy on daily basis are always in good health. My mom always eat healthy, and takes care of her diet, shes 60 years old, and she doesnt have any diseases or anything. Shes in good health. So, she always tells me to stay determined to eat healthy, stay hydrated, and that should be the case for everyone else as well. Changing to a healthier menu is a good idea because students will eat well, and start to like the healthy food instead of the junk food. Eventually, students will start to like fruits and vegetables instead of chips and chocolates, and drink more water instead of soda, juice, and stay hydrated. They will be diligence towards their diet. Students will eat oat meal, milk, yogurt, and some fruits in the morning from the cafeteria. It would digest easily and students will not have stomachache or any other kind of pain in the morning after eating breakfast. In lunch, they will eat proteins, for example: meat, nuts, and beans, also milk, water, stay energized for the rest of the day, and not have any disease or pain. Students will not be obese or gain a lot of weight. They will stay in shape because they will be eating healthy food from the cafeteria, and they will not have unhealthy condition of body or mind. Students will maintain their health, and stay fit by following their diet. Their body will not contain any impurities, and they will not have any diseases. Students will be able to play sports, run fast, accomplish their goals, and discover new things in life. Also, they will be more active. If youre fat then you become lazy, always not willing to work which is not good for health. You have to be productive in order to achieve your goals in life. Students will not eat junk food from the cafeteria anymore, and it would give students the opportunity to keep up with their body and be fit. Students will be healthy instead of getting sick every other day. Eating healthy is good because you learn how to maintain your health, and it helps you to eat well. Students will the eat the food that is good for their health. Eating healthy on daily basis, and going to the gym maximum twice a week can keep them in shape, and get rid of the illness. Healthier school lunch menu would benefit a lot of students, and illustrate them ""To purify, and be bright"". My cousin Generic_Name used to eat unhealthy all the time, even from school cafeteria as well, and always used to cry about how her stomach used to hurt. After six months she gained weight, and she was crying about it that shes never going to be fit again because she gained too much weight, but my mom told her that theres always a second chance, she was eating unhealthy, and wasnt taking care of herself so thats why she gained weight. She told Generic_Name about her healthy diet and convinced her to immediately start eating healthy, stay hydrated, do not eat junk food on daily basis, and be diligence about working towards her goal to be fit. Generic_Name listened to my mom and started eating healthy, she lost weight right after 8 months, and her stomach didnt used to hurt like it used to before all the time, thats why students need to eat healthy food from the cafeteria, and take care of their diet because they spend majority of their time in school. It might not be the best food for the students but its good for their health. Junk food is not good for health. Cafeteria should have healthy lunch menu. So, students can have the opportunity to eat healthy and not face any dificulties related to their health. Its a very good idea to tell students to fix their diet, and start to become responsible for what is good for their health and immune system. Students will not gain a lot of weight if they stick to their diet and eat healthy from the cafeteria. Students wil not have stomachache or any other diseases. They will be able to trust the process of eating healthy, and keep up with it. Cafeteria should only have healthy food. So, people can minimize the amount of junk food they eat on daily basis.

263,2609,61E85C09E36D,"Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble,or do they unfairly interfere young peoples lives? In my opinion yes curfews have to take care of them , it does matter if they are young, Also if they are in the night. This is a good intention from curfews, to protect them at the end the only beneficiaries are the teenagers. For example if they are in the middle of the night they can get a trouble , because they going to do wherever they want when nobody is watching them, for other part if curfews say not they have to respect the rules . Otherwise nobody are in the street playing or doing something good in the night, all people are in home resting or with their family doing other things, they have to apply the same for teenagers. Also in the night someone can steal your properties, or doing something bad to someone or to you , why? to you because maybe you are watch what others are doing to someone, and you try to help or do something. Some people thing that have fun in the night is good idea. but is not, for examples going to the clubs is not good in my opinion, because you dont not anybody ,or something can happen ,for example in Las Vegas almost 3 years ago someone shooting a club in the middle of the night many people die.

Am against it myself I forget everybody forgets things but not all of us do but a lot does. Sometimes we purchase things and forget that we did tell we see the package in our doors or mail box then we gonna realize that we purchase something and forget about it.

I myself cant tell who was my childhood best friend or my first dogs name. a lot of us dont know when we got married with our wife or husbands a lot of us dont even know some of our grandparents names is lot if things that we easily forget in life so easily. Am against it because i so it my self people forget easily a lot and there will be no human who will stand and say i dont forget or i know everything in life all what i have learn since my childhood life i can still say it and tell you all about it that is not possible. A lot can say stuff like that will not be able to do or say about it.

For example I have friends that do school at home and they are just like regular kids from High School, a lot of people would say that being home school its like going to prison but its not, home school just gives us a better way of learning at home with no one to bother. Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abues in school, not dealing with any problems with other students. Another benefit of being home school is that you dont have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you dont have to miss the bus anymore, dont have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school dont have time to go out or have som fun, not many kids are able to go out becasues their parents are strict and dont let them out but thats besides the point, many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them becasue they dont want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with thme so they dont have to miis out on their aventues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the out side world becasue their education was high quiality and always on point.

267,2613,65975436BE5C,"True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem. First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self. Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going. Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished. In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.",9,7,8,7,8,6,1326,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

I disagree with that because, many students have other activities after school. It could also affect the teachers by them staying after longer and kids would just have to take in a lot of new material including homework and its not healthy for them. I feel like when they add extra school hours to the day it would mess the students schedule up, they could have sports after school or tutoring. They could really enjoy their activities and for them not to be able to do any of that anymore does not seem fair.""I have soccer practice every day after school and I love it and it would be a shame if i had to give it up because of more school.""The parents would also have to change their schedule because they could be at work and then have to leave to pick up their children, they would also not have as much time hanging out with friends or family because school would be their main focus when they could be outside being kids. However students enjoy seeing their friends at school and saying ""hello or hi"" we need more time to communicate as well so our friendships dont fade. Teachers as well would have to work longer shifts, and they already stay after grading students papers while they also have to find out what the next lesson is going to be the next day. They take time out of their day to help the students who are falling behind in the subject and need a little more help to make sure they succeed in school and in their future. Teachers also have families just like every other person in the world, which means they should be able to go home at a good time and help their children out with their work or be able to cook dinner and take time out to care for their kids. Teachers need breaks as well they work very hard to maintain the material we need to understand. They leave the school late like 5-6 and when they leave they look exhausted just imagine them leaving at 7-8 including the fact that they sometimes would stay after helping students and that makes the student tired. We need to give teachers some credit and not push the limits for them as well. Students stay at school for eight hours each day and if you extend it to nine and a half hours that does not seem like a good amount for students. If they get a lot of work on top of their homework that could stress them out, and because of that their grades could go down because of to much work. We only get three months from school and some shorts breaks and then we have nine months of school, and then you add another hour then what is the point of a break when you just make the school days longer. Kids love going outside and doing there hobbies they cant just sit in a chair all day that also just makes them more irritated. Students also have tests and quizzes including homework each week. If you add more hours kids are probably going to fall asleep and not pay attention which would lead to not participating, students would not have a good attitude either because they would be grumpy and upset that the school day is longer. Our brain can only take so much and they would over due it which is not good for our health. We sleep 9-12 hours a day and have another eight hours at school and then we come home and do more school work and study which leads us pretty much with two hours of they day for us to eat and get ready for bed, just so we can do it over again the next day. As a student I feel like that would be to much. We are people not robots we need to live not be stuck in a building all day long. We have family and friends that we want to spend time with and that wont be able to happen if they change it because,"" they think we need longer days."" Yes we need our education and we will get it, but for now we only live once so need to make it count and focus on the present.",8,8,7,8,8,7,2432,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
272,2618,A5056E812783,"If you ask people ""When are you feel happy?"". Most of them can respond that they feel happy in some kind when they are succesful, with a less of problems and failures. But what are in the another side of this success? How people get this success? Nobody cant tell whole way of getting succesful. But why? Everyone went a hard, full of pitfall way. It wasnt easy, it was hard when you tried to achieve ones goal. Succesful people hadnt easy way of getting succesful. Failure is in some kind examination, challenge for us when we are trying to stay succesful. Succesful people must pass all kind of failure examination that to show that they are strong, sturdy, and patient. Success doesnt like weak and whiner people. For example, famous people like musicians and composers: Bach, Mozart, Beethoven; writers like Shakespeare, Stendal, Tolstoy, and Pushkin; scientics like Einshtein and Tesla. They all are famous now, because in their time they had goal: be succesful and do those things that they are like to do by their soul and heart. They had failures and opponents, peoples who just only hate and envy them. And now youre just can only imagine on how much those people were full of enthusiasm and pation that we know about them now, in our time. They are examples of succesful people for us now. Nobody of famous and succesful people dont tell you that it was easy way of stay succesful. Because it is true. And everyone has different failures; you cant feel those failures like feels those person by itself. And nobody cant tell you that the way to stay success will be easy. It is a very big number of people, who pray to achieve their goal, but with the first failures they just stopped and go back, they loss their enthusiasm. And this people just need to be pushed with someone with the words ""Hey! Whats happen? This is all all that you can show? Other people have more failures then you, you must go forward! You mustnt to be afraid to see with your eyes your failure. You must be strong."" And I think they can find some strength. There are a lot of different meetings, conferences, and seminars with a succesful and famous in some way people. There you can hear more good things that can help you to improve, to achieve your goal and stay succesful. But you cant hear all of the failure that would be connected personaly with you, and on how much it can be hard, that you still have enthusiasm that help you to solve your problems and improve. When you stay on the way to achieve your goal, because of the failures you can forget why you do all this things, you need to remember all of the good things you now that will be when you achieve your goal and stay, at first, success for yourself. With a failures you stay more self-controlled, and grew up more inside of you, stay more confident in your deed. In our life we stay succesful with everyday for ourself too. We have some small and big goals that we want to achieve. Our life is the way to stay succesful. We are achieve our goals for stay succesful in the school, in the college or university, in the sport, and on the work. To stay succesful it is not easy way with a failures that pursuit us.

273,2619,F4EA60BCBC2C,"Many people prefer to work in a group, because they think it can be more helpful, and others people said that they prefer to work alone. There are some benefits of working in a group and working alone. I think that the best option is to work in a group. When you work in a group you can finish faster. For example, if there is a group of three people, one people can be doing a job, while you are doing an other, and the third people can be doing an other. That is a smart and easy way to finish the work faster. Working in the group can be very helpful for planing how to do a project. Like as, all the people in the group gives their opinion of how to do the project and everyone in the group hears the ideas and them, they vote for the best idea in the group. That is a key point of working in the group everyone express them self and the work become easily. In a group you can have better ideas. For example, you are in a group, and you have an idea and you tell the idea to the group, all the people in the group is going to give an opinion, and they will tell you if your idea is good or it is bad. In that way you can have more ideas for you and your group, and your group and you can learn more from your ideas. Working in a group can be more helpful, because you and all the people in the group can have more ideas and finish faster. Even thought some people prefer to work alone, because they think that they can be more concentrate and they can learn faster. In conclusion in a group you can finish faster and have more ideas for you and your group. While working alone you can concentrate more because you have less talking, and you are less distracting,when you work alone you can learn more, because you find the answer at your own.

276,2622,3821238FE334,"""I dont need to go to school for to learn new things, I can learn the same things in my home"" Some students believe that is not necessary go to school to learn because they can attend classes from home. Some schools offers distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. This is a good option for students whose can not come to school for their jobs or their kids but, they want to study and to get a High School Diploma. The majority of people assure that students need come to school for to learn but, they are wrong because students can learn the same things at home. Many students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home. First, Some students can not come to school everyday because they have a full-time job and their parents do not support them. For example, Many students do not have the same opportunities than others students so, they have to become independent. As a result, they have to leave from their homes and to find a job so, they sacrifice to study because they dont have time to come to school. With this option, they can go to work then, they can take their classes at home after work without to feel pressure by their responsibilities. Second, This option can avoid the absents for students dont like come to school. For example, Some students dont like come to school and they prefer stay at home because they are attacking by schools bullies. These students feel more confident in their home than in the school and, they believe that this option is the best way for to solve their schools problems. They also prefer this option because they are shy and they dont like to speak or to do presentations in front of the class by the students make fun of them. Another reason for this option can would help many students is the students have kids and they can not come to school by their kids because they dont like that another person take care their kids and they prefer stay at home with their kids than come to school. Attending classes from home is an excellent strategy for students whose can not come to school by their kids because they will can take the classes and to get a High School Diploma without to leave their kids with someone else. As you can see, Many students would benefit form being able to attend classes from home because its a big opportunity to finish their High School even if they can not come to school frequently by their jobs or kids. It also helps students dont feel confident in the school for schools bulliers or their feelings. ",7,6,7,5,6,5,729,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
277,2623,746A0BFABA84,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why should first impressions defined who you are? Why are they so ""impossible"" to change? are first impressions really that important, why should something so small change the way you think about someone. First, no one is perfect. Everyone has very different personalities or ways of being. Second, it shouldt defined who we are. First impressions dont always go well, you should be able to change that. Finally, It could ruin your reputation. A lot of people care about their reputation a lot. To the point that it could be emotionally wrecking First, no one is perfect. We arent perfect beings, we all have different personalities. Different things we do that others dont and some people may think its weird or we are weird to do that. Thats when first impressions come to play. Meeting someone for the first time can often be hard to manage since is the first time you are meeting this person. Truly anything could go very wrong. They could think they way you talk, eat, and act is weird because you are trying way to hard for it to not go bad and sometimes that comes out as bad. Life sometimes will go wrong and we cant change that or let it get the best of us because we arent perfect and its okay if sometimes things dont go our way of liking. if it goes bad we should be able to change it or try again. Second, it shouldt defined who you are. Every human is not alike in any way possible, all of us are unique in our own way. Sometimes we make mistakes and theres cases where people dont like that. When you are on a stated of mind of anger, you could do something drastic but that doesnt defined who you are on your heart and mind. You have your own mistakes and flaws but that isnt you is just a part of you that doesnt think and does thing on impulse. When you are trying to make everything perfect that person it could stress you out really bad and anything could make you go off. when its the first time meeting that person it can really tress you out bad but thats okay. First impressions should be able to be change because if that were to happen it could really damage a person if that certain person was important to them. You should be able to reschedule the date when everything is better and you can be normal. If they are truly your friend they will allow to you to that. Finally, it could ruin your reputation. Lets say you are the most friendly person in your school and everyone likes you because of how fun or nice you are. you would love to keep that way. But one day a new student comes to your school and you introduce yourself but right out of the bat they dont like you without knowing anything about you. That thought could eat you up for the rest of the time, and you try and try to get that person to like you but they dont. Being able to change that first impression is all that you would like to do but it feels impossible. But it isnt impossible if that person wanted to get to know you they could but they dont want to and yes theres people like that all over the world. Having a second chance could change everything for you but we shouldt let it get the best of us that person will come around at their own time. We cant make people be our friend if they dont want to. If they want to get to know you they will. Conclusion, First impressions are not important things will go wrong sometimes and thats okay. We can always try again another day, it shouldt get the best of us or makes us feel some type of way if that person truly wants to be your friend they will not care about the mistakes you make or anything around that. You are human and you make mistakes sometimes. And thats okay, it doesnt defined who you are;only you know who you are on the inside. First impressions shouldt even be a thing they stress you out and makes you over think. Being able to change the impossible is something we should be able to do always.

278,2624,EFDC396D9F7A,"Date 3/12/2020 To: The school From:Generic_Name RE: Classes online Not bacause I take classes online many of the students will not be responsible and they miss many grades, They will even have not internet in online classes for be doing their own things at home for example, if i have online classes i would be distranted by my brother or other things and i feel that my online classes is not would not be good idea like i say that online class is not a good idea there are many distraction. also, if we have that problem I think that beging with teachers is the best idea cause they help us a lot in the amies. The firs reason is not all student have the internet in the houses some students dont have the internet because their parents dont have too much money to but one or maybe because they dont have the tecnology. One friend told me that their parents think that the tecnology is bad for him because it is distraction and he needs to focus on his future. and if he dosent take that class online he will fall that class. every parents think different. Another reason because not all student are not responsibles. some student came to school but they dont do anything but it the teacher letf them that they need to do this, they do it, because they feel pressure and they know that the fall the class but is their class is online they will no care about the class, And they dont will take care about the class. The conclusion is tha bad idea take classes online because the internet is one of the things that they need it, anbd not all the students have it, they need to have their responsability the class and not to all the student care for their classes, and the last thing is because not al the students like to have classes online because they know that they cant consentrate in their house bacause all the noise around.

279,2625,E3D9EE7C68F1,"Have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? Theyre thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world. Most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. Not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they dont like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around whats around the world. I would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to Disney or travel to a different state where you live. The first reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to the zoo. Most zoos can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. The zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. For example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. Also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. You can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. In my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun. The second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a Disney park. A large of number of people that I have known go to Disney to have fun with their family members. For example, at a Disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you havent tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. For example, if you watch Disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. Also, going to Disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. It will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. In my opinion, Disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you. The third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. For example, going to the Bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. Also, going to the beach in the Bahamas is another way to have fun, the beach is going to relax you in a type of way that you will not imagine. Exploring the world, or trying new things from a different state or country is a type of having fun, You can got to different parks, different beaches, and different restaurants where you can try different type of foods that you havent even tried and that are the bets. In my opinion, going to different countries, or different states that you have never been is the third reason why its a great idea to go and have lots of fun. Many people like to have fun in different ways not just being outside. Most people like to spend time alone or with their family members. Theres different types of way to have fun at different places not only going to the zoo, going to Disney a park, or going to a place that you have never been or explore what is it like to be in another country. Find a way to have some fun outdoors and all the things that keeps you stress are going get away in a second. Spending time in something that you really love is a great feeling that you will have experience in your life. Have fun with all the people that you love and that is around you because spending time with them and going to parks with them is the best feeling that you ever will ever have.

And identifying what is the best college for me to attend, because of my career.

281,2627,8476588805D9,"3/7/2019 Cedar Walk Way, Generic_City To the manager of Amazon School is the place where we get opportunity to learn different things. Schools makes you capable to choose your own way. The main reason to go school is to make our career. Career is directly related to the employment. Everyone wants to do the best in their life. Employment is the thing that helps you to do best in your life and also helps us to understand who we are and how important we are. Now a days, school have partnerships with companies to help students to choose their interests employment. So, if you select me to visit and learn about the works, it will helps me to understand about the interest that I have for my future. The most important things in students life is to choose their own interest, to make their future happy and peaceful ,but they really dont understand where will they go because of the pressure in their mind. So, I want to be selected to visit and learn about the work. It helps me to understand about the characteristic of the different works, and also helps me to recognize my interest for my career. Employment is not the biggest thing,but the interest is the biggest things. If we have interest in something, we defiantly work hard to get that goal. For example: I had a one friend whose name is Generic_Name, she choose to be a doctor in first, but then she realize that she never had any interest in doctor. After that, she left her job and become a photographer because photographic is her real interest not to be a doctor. Thats why, I dont want to be confuse in my life. I want to be clear about my future. All the people in this world are different, they have different aim in their life. Some wants to be doctor,some wants to be an engineer,pilot,photographer,dancer,etc. In this 21st century,all the parents wants their children to be a doctor or an engineer or in the other biggest post but not all the children have same interest as their parents have. Although they have different aim or interest, they join in the work that their parents wants because they dont understand the value of their interest. So, if the school or any companies allow students to explore or visit about the works, they better understand the value of their interests and never join in any other works that they dont want to be. I have an example of my own sister: In first, she joined in the medical line because my parents wants her to be a doctor and after she read some of the courses of the medicine,she realize that her interest is not to become a doctor and then she left her courses and start another courses. So, I really dont want that same things happened to me. Time is very important for everyone. Nobody wants to waste their time because they believe that time is money. So,why students waste their time to choose the way that they dont want to go. Everyone has rights to select their own jobs. The problem is not that they dont get opportunity to choose their jobs,the problem is that they dont understand where is their destination. For example: If you left your dog in a street that he never walked, then how can you expect that he accomplished his destination? Same happened to the students life, if someone who is well-experienced didnt tell them about the journey of life or how to choose their interest,how can we except that they will become a successful person. Lastly, I want to say that if you select me to visit and learn about the work ,then I get opportunity to learn about my interest which helps me to get a better future. And also, if you select me I will aware other people about the interest or works and also help them to choose their interest. If I understand my journey, then I expect that I will success to get my destination. So, I humbly request you that please select me to visit and learn about the work that I have interest to do.

Other reasons that behind people think they should keep working are it can let people have the spirit about do not give up and have brave to try something. But people will get lost when they working to hard, they do not know what should to do, and if they failed about what they doing now, they will be worry about next time when they want to do something, they became afired to try.

284,2630,4F89EB8CB97F,"I think this is a great idea, normally a person graduated in four years, but if we graduate en three years of school it will be the best for our future, because we can take advantage, start college one year early, and finish it one year early, and it will better for any student who wants to take advantage in life. I think it will be better but this is going to be hardest because you have to study more time, and have classes in summer, and evenings but all effort has its rewards. If two girls are in High School one of these (person A) took the programs that allow students to graduate in three years, and the other one (person B) took the traditional four years. The person A graduated from high school in 2015 and the person B in 2016. while the person A was studying her first year in college and working, the person B is in her last year of school, obviously 2019 is the last year for person A in college and graduate from college will help her to work in something about her career. Well what I do is if I graduated in just three years I will take advantage for work hard and take some few classes before go to college all the fourth year, and then the next year I will have a good amount of money for college, and when I going to college I keep working but less hours, I think this of allow high school students to graduated in three years is great idea. Knowing that the students only have three years in high school it will help the students to put effort in high school and to finish early high school and college. If more students are interests in this program it would be better for everyone, because you are going to graduate in three years, you are going to college, and then you are going to be a young professional. I think that if you are young and professional you will have more opportunities to have a job in everywhere. people is going to say that the high school is going to be more difficult because you are going to have many classes in only three years, and that you will not enjoy your vaccation in summer or can not do something that you like in evenings, but how I said before all efforts has its rewards. If you finish school early and going to college after that you can enjoy or do everything.",5,5,6,6,6,6,1042,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
285,2631,6FEF6D46714D,"Has it ever crossed your mind that people today are struggling to make their own decisions, and wanted feedback from other people and just maybe wanted to change their mind. Well people today are just going what their own decisions they make, I am the type of person to ask for some feedback or ask other people about, is this a good choice im making, can I do something better then what I did yesterday. I believe that people should take other peoples guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matter due to people wanting help in the real world, and also tell them about the past so they do not mess up on there life choices. What is more important the choices you make or the outcome of it? Teenagers about my age need to make better choices, but why you may ask. Today Teenagers are just ruining their own life in school. Teens need to focus on what is right for them making better decisions, like not to drink, help mom out in the kitchen, and do something productive. Teens decisions now can affect the decisions they will make sometimes in the future. For example I changed one of my friends decisions to not drink because that will cause him in the long run, like ever makes it big and someone sends that picture to social media his life can be ruin. Therefore I think teens or people should also ask other people that have already or still is living for a better decisions in important matters. Why should I go to someone else for a better decisions for some dumb reason they are going to give me, wrong. If you ask someone, you should actually listen to see what they have to say and understand the concept. It is better to have someone else opinion on how to change my decisions. Well they have lived longer than you have, they have more experience,and more life choice taking. All im trying to say is that in my opinion is that you should always take someone else decision because maybe it will help other people in the long run. Maybe it will lead them to build something amazing, start their brand company. Just something between those lines. Someone else decisions can actually change the person you are right now. Ive had so many people bring me down on how Iam going to never make it the Army branch. Im just gonna be a lawn mower, a person who just cuts grass for living. Even though they making money that not my passion. My recruiter told me to never let someone enter your head with bad thought and let them struggle you with these bad thoughts. One of his saying was ""yesterday was the past,today is the present,and tomorrow is a mystery"". In conclusion People should take other peoples guidance from experts and authorities about matters due to people needing a little more help, telling them stories about the past so they dont go through that rough past and make the same mistakes. I agree that some people may not what to interact with other people or even care about what they want to say. I agree but if you just hear them out they might just convince you to change your mind. All Iam just trying to say if you do not like the hits or opinion they are trying to give you just back off and find someone new or just go with the flow and follow what your heart attends you to do.

286,2632,B204869FA146,"Is technology a positive or negative effect on human life? Technology is a negative effect on all human life because it is a limitation on communication. With technology there is no talking to others, so you become socially awkward. You would not be able to talk infront of a crowd and you do not go out to meet new people. People become socially awkward by not having the practice to communicate with others. You can not spend the rest of your life shopping online hiding from people. People who do not socialize hide their face when speaking, they can not even order food without getting shy. It is sad how the world is relaying on technology to do everything for them. Something that is amazing is having someone to talk to in person. You would be able to see their emotions and feel their energy when you are talking to them. People are not their just to listen but to also give advice to you. I do not think technology does the same. It does not ask how was your day or how are you feeling because it is not human it is a robot. When you do not talk to enough people in your life you start to become shy. You will start to realize that in almost every job you need to talk in front of a crowd of people. Even if you can not do that you will have to because that is part of your job just to communicate. That is why in school they start to teach you at a very young age how to communicate. Teachers asign presentations for the students to get comfortable talking to others. Practice is the best way to handle talking to others because talking through the phone and in real life are two different things. When talking on the phone you do not need to see the person you are talking to or you can even just hang up. But in real life you have to learn how to start a conversation with someone and keep the conversation going. People do not go out to find new friends. Yes, it is awkward going up to someone and saying, do you want to be friends. But that is where it all starts by making one friend you have achived a lot because now you have a friend that you can talk to and not feel alone. You can not stay at home just being online. You should ask your friend do you want to go watch a movie or go eat. That is better then staying at home a playing games all by yourself. Yes, you can talk with your friends and play games at the same time but it is also important to change things up a little bit. Just once in a while find something else to do rather than sitting at home. You can do a sport. You communicate a lot when playing a sport. Being at home you are just surounded but technology and you would never really get away from it if you do not try. Another thing: making friends on socail media is not the same as in person. There might even be a chance you never meet the person you met online or might not even be the person you thought they would be in person. In conclusion even though technology is a great way to communicate with others that are long distance. It is still important to communicate face to face. Even if it is just for a couple of minutes you should still have someone to talk to. So that later on in your life if you get a job that involves you talking to a crowd you would not be scared. Also going out once in a while is not bad. You should not just stay at home playing games with your friends asked them do you want to go for a walk then you could talk to them in person. It is always a good thing to stay away from technology just somethings. There are other things that you can do even alone. You can read a book, sketch and color, or even just have a nice relaxing walk just to think. Technology should not stop you from having a good life and communicating with others. Just remember technology to some people is everything but to you it should not be.",7,7,7,7,7,7,2396,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Therefor my others friends who think that is not good, because they need go prepared to the college, so they says if I finish early high school I cant go prepared to the college; Another reason is that no body want lost time, for that reason my friend Generic_Name finish high school early, but many youngest are lazy. Every school need offer that program, the program is really important because can help a lot students to finish high school early; Also, a lot student want finish early.

288,2634,2F3210D23414,"Students now can take classes from their houses. Schools are offering students the possibility to take classes online from their houses, I think is a excellent idea because sometimes students dont have the possibility on getting a ride to get to school, or it makes it easier for students that have to stay home for personal reasons, or even if you want to take a class during the summer to get more credits and get to graduate earlier. Sometimes students do not have the possibility on getting rides to school and the county do not offer them a bus transportation system that can take them to school, for example in my country Costa Rica there is not a free transportation system to get to school and the only transportation system is the public one and you will have to pay for it, its an excellent idea from the schools to have this kind of classes that you can take from your own house. Some students have reasons that make them stay home, such as girls being pregnant, students taking care of their parents that need people to take care of them because they are sick or have any disability and they can not stay home alone, in those cases students can finish their school courses at home and take care of their loved ones at the same time. Some students just do it to finish high school earlier, they have the opportunity on taking classes online during the summer and be able to get less classes on their senior year or just graduate earlier if they taking the standard diploma, that is a smart thing to do if you are planing on go to college and finish your carrier on a young age, and start working at young age too. On my opinion I think that having that opportunity is a good thing and a bad thing because going to school is the best decision that you can make on your life, you get to make friends and get to know a lot of people during all the time you spend at school, but not everyone have that opportunity, thats why this opportunity that the school is giving you is unique and can help you a lot, the only thing you need is a computer or a electronic device that can get access to the internet.",8,7,7,7,8,8,625,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
289,2635,4C17DB6FF2DC,"John Lubbock quotes on choosing your own character or letting influences form your is a passage I can live by. For the reason of it being actually true because, sometimes things you see throughout your life would change your character. The people you look up to can can your character because you want to be just like them. but sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence. Things you see in life can change your character. Lets say you are in the streets and you get into a car accident then you are gonna have a chance to be afraid to drive a car. It can also be changed by a bad experience, lets say you are in an abusive relationship after that relationship ends you would think every girl/guy is an abusive person. What if you are living in foster care and you never get adopted you will think that you will never among to nothing and be nothing your whole life. The people you look up to can have a dramatic change in your character. Lets say your father is your biggest inspiration you will want to be just like him when your older and follow in his foot steps. But, if your inspiration isnt anyone in your family but it is a famous sport player you will grind your butt off just to be in the same team with them and hopefully play along side with that player. Newer influences these days are trough social media and movies and in my opinion those are the worst ones because they usually trying to sell you something or market something to their audience. Sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence. Having a bad influence can lead to a lot of trouble and you can even end up in jail for it. Lets say you look up to your father and he is a very toxic person and a violent person and you end up like him thats not a good thing. Also something that can happen is that you look up to a very bad very disturbing person and he likes to hurt people and then you start hurting people because you want to be just like him. Depending on who your inspiration is it will develop the way your character comes out. ",6,7,7,8,8,7,995,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Technology allows such great effects in our lives. Everything is easier to get, games, books, news, and even shopping would be easier for everyone. Say your teacher wants students to read a certain book but there isnt any left in class. What would you do?. Technology will allow students to download the book and still be on task with students. Some teaches dont allow you to take the book home but with any device you can simply download the book and still be caught up with the chapter. You wouldnt be behind.

They dont like to miss the days news or any news. If they did, they can type the date and see whats happening. You wouldnt miss a thing! alerts will pop up on your device to inform you. Therefore, everyone stays connected to the world in any device. Technology, also allows you to stay connected with other, such as your parents and friends.

292,2638,951DBA563386,"Do you make your own decisions or do you seek guidance from experts ? I believe that people should be able make their own decisions. I believe this because people are not away right about things and what they say. Another reason would be because only yourself know what chooses you want to make in life and so those are your decisions. My third reasons why I would say that people should be able to make their own decisions is because you shouldnt follow what others do. You always see people making good or bad chooses or making not good decisions but does that mean you got to do what others do, no because you have to make those chooses on your own. My decision for people to make their own decisions would be because trusting others on what they say isnt always the right things. Would you want your best friend making a decisions for you ? Maybe not because you never know if she/he could be right or telling a lie. People in life are not always right about things ,you dont want to get in trouble for doing something dumb or that isnt the right thing for you to do . If you make a good decision on something at school or basically anywhere you can show others on how to make good chooses so they wouldnt make mistakes . This why you shouldnt listen to people making decisions for you this is because they can cause problem and get you in a situation where you dont want to be put in. In life theirs so many things you can do but it all up to you . You decide what you want to do, you shouldnt let other people judge you in your decisions because they shouldnt get in involved . This is because everyone does what they want to do in life . If you make a bad decision thats all on you because you made the decision not someone else you cant blame others for that when it comes to you getting involved in a situation that you got yourself put in. I know your children in school mightve gotten in trouble with something and if not it because they are great children who dont follow what others do. There are ton of students in school who make bad decisions and this because they like to do what others do by following what others do and seeing others do bad chooses. In that case that is not right because it makes them get in trouble and they lose time of education for making bad decision. When it comes to making your decisions you make your chooses. Only you know what chooses you want to make. If you do dont want to do something you shouldt do it . Dont be afraid to not do something because you think it a bad decisions just first before everything think about what your doing. You should always question yourself is it a good choose or not because your the one making your own chooses. Everyone is their self you shouldnt be controlled by anyone. When it came to me making new friends at school I choose wisely with who I would want to be friends with because I didnt want me to be influenced by making bad chooses by others. No one has the right to choose to do things for others when it comes to making chooses it all depends on yourself. In conclusion just always remember that you should always pick your decisions and not others for you. I know in the world we live in we all know that not everyone makes good chooses which is okay in some cases. This just means that not everyone is perfect which is true because their is at least one thing in life that you made a bad decision on. People just need time to think about what chooses or decisions they want to make so that after they make the chooses or decisions they dont think about it twice and why they shouldve made a wisely decision. Dont let yourself down or stress about whats rights for you in life. ",5,5,6,5,4,5,1971,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
293,2639,31B604C7D90F,"Should school cafeteria change to a new, healthier lunch menu, for students? In this essay, I will argue why school should not change to a new healthier lunch. School should keep the same lunch menu because students will lost their favorite foods, students will start to pack their own lunch, and foods will be wasted. Reasons why school should keep the same lunch menu instead of changing to a new, healthier school lunch menu, because each students have their own favorite foods, such as Chicken Sandwich, Pasta Chicken, and Tortilla. Futhermore, Tuesday is my favorite lunch day because its Tortillas day. Tortilla, also a healthy food because it have a corns, meats, tomatoes and other vegetables depend on what we like. For me, when I get to eat my favorite foods I feel blessed especially when Im hungry. These days, there are many restaurants out there like Mcdonald, ChickfillA ,and many more. Hence, instead of paying for school lunch that you dont like people can just bring their own lunch from home or from outside. Its better for people to buy foods from outside rather than buy foods at school and wasted. Sometime home foods are cleanier than school foods. Students might consider bringing their own lunch. The good thing about it is we can choose what we want to eat. Every type of foods are expensive, we the students doesnt want to waste it. Thinking back to the poor people outside there craving for foods, I felt bad for them. In contrast, its hard for us to eat the foods we doesnt like even if we are hungry. If the students doesnt like the foods, they might throw away, or not purchasing it. The school foods will be wasted, and at the end they will throw it away too. Providing students favorite foods are important, students will eat and school will not suffer from wasted. School cafeteria should keep the same lunch menu. Some says, healthy school lunch are good for students health, but they are wrong.

I agree with this statement, because the time passes in your life is going with it, the more you do the more you get and that is what people dont get, if you want to make accomplishments in your life you have to worked out man, For example Lebron James how do you think he went where he is now, Making steps in his life, goals, family help, you have all of it it is right there you just have to get it.

296,2642,DBC8CBF56BB9,"As a child, I always loved to go to the park. It was my favorite thing to do because I loved playing games with my sisters and sometimes wed even make up our own game to play. However, things have changed in the past few years and now I barely ever go to the park. The park isnt the same fun and cool place that it used to be anymore, but why?, Why did it change so quickly?. There are so many reasons to why the park hasnt been visited as much as before, but, yet again only one reason explains why most people barely ever go to the park. The reason for why people never to go the park now is because they dont know what to do at the park anymore. People think that the park is a boring and useless place, but the park have many purposes. People now spend more time on their couch and on their phone and its very unhealthy and concerning especially when it comes to health issues in the future. The park is a fun and entertaining place to be because there are millions of activities that you could do at the park that are very enjoyable. Im going to list a wide variety of fun and entertaining activities. First off, you could always go the park with friends and/or family members. Its always great to be around the people you enjoy the most, especially in a beautiful environment like the park, where everyone could enjoy themselves. Second, you could always head to the park for some quick exercise. You could run, jog, do yoga and much more when youre at the park. Its always a good idea to clear your mind and go for a run at the park when its beautiful outside. Its always important to make sure your health is in good condition and you can make sure that happens by taking a walk at the park. The third activity is, play some fun games at the park!. When your at the park you could always play some fun games that get you pumped up and happy. With the nice, fresh, open space that is available, the possibilities are endless!. You could make up your own fun games with your friends or family members. Now my fourth fun activity is, throwing a fun party!. It could be a birthday, graduation or even a going-away party, The occasion doesnt matter at all!. Having a nice party at the park is one of the funnest things!. You could do a barbecue and play with your friends and/or family members. celebrating outdoors is a great way to have a blast. My fifth activity is, help clean the park. This activity might sound really boring but helping our your community is 100% worth all of your time. When helping out your community youre not only helping those around you but youre helping yourself, the environment and the animals. Many animals live in parks, for example. a squirrel , birds, worms and even small insects. So next time you go to the park, or are planning to go, make sure you at least pick up one piece of trash, because that small piece of trash could save the animals and the environment. Now my last but certainly not least reason is, grab a book and head to the park and read. This might seem like boring stacked on top of boring but doing this helps you clam down and relax a lot. When youre in a beautiful and peaceful environment, how could you be mad?. Why should you try one of these activities?. These activities arent only fun but they do help you in the long run. Hanging out with your friends and family members help you appreciate the people in your lives but also the environment that it giving access to being able to be around people. Taking a nice run at the park helps you by being healthy and improving your well being. Exercising doesnt have to mean running and jogging, it could be yoga too. Making up your own games help you build up your mind especially when you have access to so much space, you can pretty much create a fun and entertaining game. Reading a book is one of the most important things that you have to do in order to build up a stronger brain and doing to it in a peaceful, quite and beautiful environment makes the experience 100x more pleasing. You dont have to choose one of my ideas, you can choose and make up your own activities!. So next time you go to your local park, make sure you contribute and acknowledge the beauty of your community and make sure its being properly taken care of.",7,7,8,8,7,8,3101,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

I think this is negative, because the rate of oversize people will grow. People shouldnt spend most of there time on devices or inside. They should go out in the real world and see how things are. How nice people are to them . First, Being stuck in the house isnt fun because you wont meet new people or reconnect with people from your old school or meet the love of your life .Things like this is what makes people kill their self because they dont have fun.

My 3 reasons that students can have a easier time doing their assignments is that the students can ask their teachers for assistance if they need it, theyll get their work done quicker, and when their teachers come to collect their work, the students will have it already completed. My second reason is that the students can work together to get their homework done. My 3 reasons that students should work together to get their homework done is so that they can turn it into their teacher once theyre done, theyll have it all completed when their teacher asks the students to give their homework up, and theyll receive a good grade from their teacher. My third reason is that students can work with their teacher to raise their grades up in a specific subject. My 3 reasons that students should work with their teachers to raise their grade up in a specific subject is so that they can be more productive in class, they can catch up on what theyve missed in class, and the teacher can guide the students on what theyre confused on on their homework. Overall, these are my reasons why I think that students should have the opportunity to have an after school homework club.",6,6,6,4,8,7,3458,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
299,2645,D06951B19A28,"Most people believe that working in a group is more beneficial than working alone. Other people think otherwise, they say that working alone is more beneficial than working in a group. People is different, they have different believes and ways to work. Some people prefer working in a group for many reasons. One of that reasons is that people in a group get more things done in less time. They say that is better working with more people because when you work alone you get bored or you dont get motivated as the people that works in groups. Working in a group is better because people can share their ideas with the other people in the group and they can do a very good work using all those ideas. Also, the work can be divided in equal parts, and thats fair, in that way everybody have the same amount of work to do. Some people think otherwise, they prefer working alone for many reasons. First, it is a little bit boring because they dont have nobody to talk and to share their ideas but they know what they are going to work with. They can do their work in their own way, they can take all the time they want to do the work. Second, they do not have to wait for people to tell them what to do or to ask if the work that they did is correct. Third, people can edit their work many times without asking other people what they think about it. Another reason is that people does not have other people rushing them. And sometimes people that work in groups have a lot of issues because they do not agree with other people work, and a lot of times the grade that they got for that work is the same for every group member. That means that if somebody made a mistake every group member will be affected because of that. In conclusion, working alone is more beneficial because of a lot of reasons. Every person have their own way to work but if you work alone you are not allowed to get in issues, arguments, problems and bad grades.

Influencing others can be catastrophic or great but only a selected group of people chosen by the individual can do it. Humans are being influenced constantly by different people and ways of thinking, but he most effective ways to influence others are: peer pressure, advises from others and social stereotypes Most adolescents are extremely insecure and need their friendss approval. Many times teens are challenged by their friends in order to do something that can cause fatalities or a great success. Generic_Name was a terrible student when he moved to Generic_City from Generic_City, but when he met Generic_Name his life changed because Generic_Name peer pressured him, taught him English and influenced on him to achieve success on Generic_Names high school career. Parents, siblings, friends and idols have the power of being able of influence on others by giving advises based on their own life experiences. Old people advises are the most effective because of their great wisdom and erudition. Generic_Names grandfather was a well-known writer and gave many advises to Generic_Name about how to write good essays. after all that, Generic_Name has been awarded with different prices and many scholarships that required essays.

Because Ive never lived in some type of big house, It will show all the hard work that payed off to get the house, and it will also be the first time I go to California One thing I would like to accomplish in the future is to live in a big mansion in California. Because Ive never lived in some type of big house before. Since Ive been born Ive been living in small places with other little house nearby like town houses or apartments and for me It has me thinking. ""Why am I living in these places like I have some friends who live in houses but I dont?"" But that was me when I was like little but now I know that some parents arent as lucky as others and they struggle to find nice places to live in but they get what they can get and at least they get somewhere to live in and give their kids what they need and want so for me Its going to be hard finding a job with good paying money but if i get a degree in something I want to do then It would be amazing to do that. Another reason I would like to live in a big mansion is that It will show how rich I am and It was hard trying to buy a Mansion. Mansions these days cost so much money (of course because they are big in space and some are in private places) you can find mansions in Florida, Texas, Nevada, California, and etc. But mainly I would love to get one in California. California is a big wealthy state with many great known cities and history. It is mostly visited in the summer for its hot temperatures and great attractions. One city I would love to buy my mansion is maybe in Calabasses or Hollywood, There are many cities to get a mansion it just depends on how much it costs and how big it is on the inside and out. Last reason I would like to live in a big mansion is that it would be my first time going to California. My mom used to live in California, in a small city near Downtown Los Angeles called Generic_City. She moved from Generic_City to California when she was fourteen (which is my age currently) and she went to high school in Generic_City and learned English there and had a job. but then after finishing one year of college she moved to Virginia and had me when she was around twenty-five. But ever since then she has been telling me stories of how it was for her in California and what places she would visit over there like Disneyland, the Hollywood sign, sporting events, and more places. I would like to visit San Francisco with one of its famous attraction the Golden Gate Bridge or Go down to Venice Beach and enjoy the beautiful ocean and its hot temperature to cool off. And those were my three reasons of why I want to live in a big mansion in California because Ive never lived in some type of big house with no houses that are connected together, It will show all the hard work that payed off o get the house, and It will be my first time going to California.",8,8,8,9,8,8,96,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

This connection is established from the joy of physicle and fitness related activities that health/P.E can assure. I find this activitie mostly enjoyable since it has some of the sports I play in after hours outside of school grounds,which builds a strong connection. I also enjoy the connection i make with others such as the other students and the teacher since health/P.E are mostly social based activities, were teamwork and cooperation are needed. This is an art in which others and you could interact with each other which if to the right exstent can bring joy to those who socialize in educational manners, but with that also brings educational activities which is much more of important when it comes to P.E because education always comes first when it comes to any class in the education atmosphere. P.E may bring a positive inpact on others who need social activites to interact with others,which is what makes P.E enjoyable and impactful for me and much others.

I am agree with Emersons statement about individuality because i can demostrate that they said is wrong, to show them what is defference between to make and to talk, and to be concetrate. Those thing i can show the people that i can doing with myself and that make me a greatest accomplishment. I feel to be myself, it is not depend what people said about me. If i want to change or to be something else in a world, i have to do what my mind say to me, for example if i wanna be a teacher. And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months. But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse. Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment. Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing. For example to study, many people do not like to study because they say that school is boring so that i am doing they believe that is boring. They will try to convence me doing wrong things so i have to demostrate them that i wanna be something else in a world not just have fun. In conclusion, work individuality is not easy i have To showto the people that sometime we do not need help from somebody else.

304,2650,F386245C7C21,Have you ever wondered about your working skills do you prefer working in groups or on your own? How they benefit you in your job or anywhere else? people say that working together is a better way of doing stuff then just working alone. But theirs other people who prefer working alone. Here are some of the benefits to both sides. I feel like working in a group is more beneficial because it lets you have a chance to ear new ideas. You can also finish the work faster if everyone is doing something. For example this one time. My friends and I were doing a project for drives Ed. We had sometime to think and write down ideas. After that all of us got together and agreed on some ideas. Then we each had our own part to do and we finished it during class. Some people believe that working alone is better. You can be more focused on you work. In addtion you can be more creative in your own way. I remember this girl in my biology class had to do her finial exam project. She decided to work by herself. The girl was res reaching and was really focused on that she was looking for. She got her information then made a really creative poster that went with the theme of the project. The teacher loved it and gave her an A for it. In conclusion working in a group benefits me the most. Their is less work to do. Everyone has good ideas. You get to express thoughts and feelings about your topic. So many more things that working alone doesnt give. ,7,8,7,4,7,6,3607,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 4, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

306,2652,8F5F3F2519DA,"what do you think about a program that school provides to pair the younger students with the older students? It can be a exellent choice for the younger students and the older students. Therefore, many younger students have less experience than the older students, so the older students have more experience than them. Older student have already halfway done going to the school. Also, it has a great effect on them to be a good students. This program would help both the older and the younger student in responsibilities, socialization and improving behaviors. Certainly, this program could help both the older and the younger student in taking care of their own responsibilities. They both can get some useful knowledge that it might be helpful for them to take care of their responsibilities. It could make a good change on how they used to do their chores and homeworks. Taking care of responsibilitis is hard but if they work together than it will get more easier and better on it. It will make them productive and helpful on doing works. Like I said, it will also be useful for their future, when they will have job and other things to do. however, this program could help both the older and the younger students in socialization. It will make a great change on how they used to work in group. Usually, younger students dont like to talk to the older students, so it can make them be more confident to talk to others. Some older and younger students like to be anti social but if they join the program and work together than it will make them social. It will make a good impact in spending time with others and playing outdoor games. Also, it will effect them in good way to make some new friends. Therefore, this program will also help both the older and younger students in improving behaviors. If the older students are not respecting and talking polite with others than it will change them. Like I said, it will also help them both improve on how they used to treat other peoples. It will help them to speak a good langauge and be nice to the people they dont know. Also, it will have a good impact on their future when some students will like to a teacher when they grow up and teach their students about behaviors. In the conclusion, this program could be really helpful for both of them. It could effect both of them to learn something new that they have not know about yet. Therefore, it could be a great program for the school to start and earn money. This program could develope their minds in a good way that will impact their future and their daily life. It could be great and wonderful to learn the things that the students have been struggling in. Also, it will lead them to be a good students and a good person when they grow up.

Usually, people dont try to do something new that they are already do. What is the best advise to get growing? Ralph Waldos statement is one, which motivates to others to explore new areas, and people will not grow, if they do always the same. To begin, in the society there are many jobs where is necessary to expand in new areas to get improvement like photographers that usually work shooting pictures, but they know how to shot a video also. Photographers can explore new areas like cinematography world or work as a journalist. They know that explore new areas is best way to grow as professional. In addition, people already know that leaving the comfort zone is another way to get a personal growing like student that travels to another country to continue his studies or like a doctor how explores new medicine branches to find a cure for illness. Both have the knowledge that exploring areas that they commonly are no related, will help them to grow. Exploring new areas led everyone to get a growing. To add, People will not be able to grow, if they dont change in order to grow. Persons that know how to do something very well, such as carpenter or construction, they decide to create their own businesses ,but they are scared to fail. They are afraid to do something new as manage a businesses even if they are mastered on it. Entrepreneurs should to undertake their companies, and they should to invest in new equipment try to grow. if they just keep doing the same without invest, they will not grow as company. In contrast, many people say if someone do always the same, they will be a professional in that area. like a professional sport player because they do always the same. However, even the professional sport player do something different every time, they have to improve their skill. If they just keep doing the same they cant play and be the best player either. This ideology is applied to many different areas where the subject want to be successful. In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emersons statement has the reason, for people is not able to achieve their goal when they do constantly the same.

For example a good behavior star at home because your parents have the responsibility to educate. Also some people said the students are very bad for other students, like they are bad influence . My second, reason would be the your own problems can affect, your career. For example your grades at school if you are a good person with other people to be a good citizen just be you because people the just talk never do something good.

311,2657,3438C0C5ACEA,"I oppose to extending the school day to one and a half minutes or ninety minutes. Students need to get back home sooner so they can practice their homework and do some of their own hobbies at their spare time. Schools must have an appropriate schedule so students can actually have time to work at home afterwards. The school board shouldnt extend the school day by adding one and a half hours because the students wont have time for themselves at home, the classes would take longer, and the school will end at evening time. First off, students always want to get back home when school is over, but if the school extends the time, the students wouldnt have time to do their own activities at home. For instance, if one student comes home at 4:50 pm, and they finish their homework at 5:30 pm, then their parents would tell them to get ready for bed because kids have to sleep early at 8:00-9:00 so they can be ready for school the next day. Secondly, classes would also have an extended amount of time in the daily schedule if the school day extended. Students will start complaining about the slowness of the class due to the start and end times of classes being changed. For example, the kids would be complaining over the lesson taking so long. Some students would also fall asleep during class too. Therefore, extended class times can affect how students will behav during class. Lastly, the school will end at the evening time. Students would be feeling less energetic when school ends, and they wont be able to get home to do their homework because theyre half asleep. When they get home from school, their parents will notice how tired and exhausted they are from what happened at school and the students will have to rest and sleep for the entire day. If the school extends the schedule, then the students energy wont be enough for them when they return home from school. In closing, extending school hours will affect the students behavior and the time they have for themselves at home. The kids wont be able to do the fun stuff at their spare time after finishing their homework because they have to go to bed early for school. Theyll also feel tired and complain about the length of the school time. When they return home, theyll groggily enter the house and end up resting for the rest of the day.

312,2658,F17F4DF6095D,"In my opinion i agree honesty is the best policy sometimes, however, honesty might hurt a persons feelings because the quality of being truthfulness is the key through out life. For that reason to support my answer your being trustworthy is better than done or obtained without lying to that person. hurting them more when you lie to them then be hundred percent honest with that person. so that why i believe honesty is the best policy sometimes even if u might hurt a person feelings. First, not stealing, cheating because people will not have respect and lose trust for you. sometimes you could end up in bad situations and problems. so i feel like if you do these things i least own up to your problems by being honest by saying you did this or this happened. Also, people will say bad names to you like your all lies, your not trustworthy, and your dishonest so if you dont want anyone in this world to call you these names be honest at all times. Then, being careful and saying sorry to the things u told people that was a lie instead of being dishonest changing that honesty i say that people start thinking your real and wanna be friends with you. instead those people out there hating you and talking behind your back almost everyday. so if u do these things it could change you as what type person your now then back then and it will change how people act towards you or behind your back most of the times. Next, not hiding anything frank from people. For example, Generic_Name dating her best friend boyfriend secretly. like you dont wanna hide anything from the people you love or care for you always wanna be honest with them no matter what. you could break there hearts by not telling them somethings if the situations important that they most know. if you dont be honest life will make you feel stressful by hiding all these things your hiding from people so you do not wanna hide anything from the people u love or care for.

313,2659,F72B0C4DB804,"In todays world we accomplish many things by being active, and doing them. If we would like to achieve or accomplish something we have to be dedicated and actually try not just be inactive because this awesome life we have if full of amazing experiences. Many of us go to high school, or have jobs that we to attend and we are expected to try our best which would benefit us. Being inactive or not doing something right could lead to getting fired or failing in school which is why inactivity is known for negative results. The way we accomplish is not on how smart we are, or what people tell us to do is on if we are willing to try and keep on doing it. In the other hand inactivity may give you the time to rest at home, catch up on things but it wouldnt get you nowhere because your not being productive. For example, if your trying to get a job theres always competition for that position, the manager might want to pick the other person simply because his resume, he has involve himself in way more things like clubs and also because his ability of proving hes way better than the other person. Which is why its all about doing something so you can succeed in life rather than just sitting there and then later having the time to have fun. Lastly, the best feeling of accomplishing something is the reward, or enjoying what you have earned. For example, I am expected to do many things around the house like cleaning, feeding the dog, and even babysitting. Even though sometimes I dont want to do it, I end up accomplishing more than what I have to do because I am the type of person that likes being known for accomplishing things around the house and then having to enjoy that feeling of my parents being proud of me. Being inactive wouldnt result in a positive result to many people including me because you arent gaining anything from it. Im sure everyone loves that deep feeling when you have done something right and you get something out of it. Not many people know how wonderful it is if we are always doing something and how it can really benefit you, even on the smallest things. In conclusion, people should consider always doing something even if its something small because anyone can tell you being inactive isnt the way to live life or be. After all, the accomplishments you earned will really show off in the long run thanks to always doing something.

315,2661,FE3CA06DDCA1,Why is it when someone asks you for advice there the ones talking most of the time? Here are 2 of the reasons I think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. Reason 1 is they might want to give the on who is giving the advice all the info so then they can help them. Reason 2 is that they are give you as much detail as they have to give you good advice. They will want to give you all the information so you can probably find a solution or fix to there problem. As in this sit ions where my friend needed some advice for a test she had coming up. She was not sure what to do to study for it. She was telling me what she had to study but then she said I dont think these would help me much I told her to make flash cards out of the note she had then she did that. She was super stress. I think when your stressed you just say things that are on your mind as in you talk more. If a person wants good advice they will want to give you all the details. If you know all the details you will most likely know how t fix it. Everyone needs so good advice because the how are they going to fix there problem. If you friend has a problem and they dont tel you all the details your not really gonna give then good advice. In conclusion why you need advice you will talk more then the person who is given you the advice. When you are in a problematic event you will take a lot more because yo will be most likely stressed. Also if you give all the the details of your problem you will get good advice. ,6,5,6,6,5,5,3861,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
316,2662,C968149003DE,So many people at my middle school want to start a after school homework club and this because studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start a homework club. Well I think this idea is not going to work because student will think that they will only have to do homework at the homework club therefor when there no after school most kids wont turn in there homework. Also another problem is the volunteer work no kid wants to stay after school to help and if there only teacher I am certain that kids would lose focus. And the subject I dont think that 45 minute Are enough to learn 4 main class plus the homework thats not enough time to finish homework and learn. And many people just want to go to this homework club just to finish fast I think that people that really need it should be in this group not just cause they want to finish fast they can do that at home and after school wasting time and the teachers time. This one of the main problems I have with the homework club is that if kids go there they are only go to fool around with there friends. And not let other kids learn and do there homework and learn being a middle school er my self I have seen how most kids with there friends u would think that they are mauter but not as much. But many people say maybe if you let them they will change but so many people have goint chances but they keep doing the same thing. As a conclusion I think that this after school program has no use because homework is called homework for a reason and if u do at school they would not do at home when theres no after school so this after school program will not work for many reason like no a enough time not enough focus distractions. And people who just want ot play and not do work and volunteering kids dont want to stay extra and kids wont pay anttion to the teacher. ,6,6,5,5,6,6,2738,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
317,2663,BF580042A644,"The city council is debating on having curfews for teenagers, weekdays they have until 10 p. m and on the weekends they have until midnight. This is for the teenagers to be safe and not be out late because something could happen to them if they are out on the streets at night. This rule would be an outstanding one because they can cause less trouble and they can stay out of trouble at the same time. This rule wont interfere with young peoples life, it would keep them safe at home and their parents dont have to worry about them doing anything bad. The teenagers can be talking to their friends, loved ones, and family on their phone or be playing with them on PlayStation or Xbox. My first reason why I think they should the adopt the curfew rule is because it keeps them at home and keeps them safe. For an example, if your teenager stays home and doesnt go out passed his curfew then he or she wont get hurt or even worse shot by a dangerous person . If the city council adopt the curfew rule they can prevent your son or daughter from getting beat up or getting shot . This rule can prevent anything dangerous happening to your son or daughter, this will keep them inside and they can study, catch up on miscomplete assignments , and do homework. You wont have to worry about them that much because you know they are safe at home and wont try to get you in a serious problem. Its also your job as parents to keep watch out on your son or daughter because they can try sneaking out. The city council cant really do anything about your teenager sneaking out from your house so you are responsible for watching your kid. My second reason why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule is to keep your teenager from breaking the law and to keep them from doing horrible things. To demonstrate, If your teenager is not out on the street then he or she can be drawing or painting on paper instead of doing graffiti on building or walls . This could prevent teenagers from getting in trouble and prevent people from cleaning up the teenagers own mess. If you have talent to draw amazing objects then try showing it in school or on your personal items and not on the cities property. I suggest buying a ton of paper or objects that you can paint on instead of doing graffiti on buildings or walls own from the city council. If your teenager is caught doing this , he or she is gonna be in a serious problem and they will have to clean it. My final reason why I think its important to have a curfew rule is because this will prevent your teenager from doing illegal things such as drinking or doing drugs. We dont know what our kid could be doing passed curfew so I think we need this curfew so we can make sure they are not doing anything illegal. This keeps our kid safe and also out of trouble because its horrible to be drinking and doing drugs. For an example ,If your teenager was caught doing illegal things and doing it passed curfew , it would be extremely terrible and your teenager would be in a whole lot of trouble. This is why having a curfew and checking on your kids room once in awhile will help you prevent this from happening and also keep your teenager from having a black out, crashing or a overdose. If your teenager has some bad friends, tell your kid to stop talking to them because they might try forcing him or her to do something that they do not want to do. Instead of doing those things , just talk to your loved ones, friends, and family on the phone or play with them on PlayStation or Xbox. As a result, having a curfew on weekdays and weekends is important because this could prevent anything from happening to your teenager. I do not think they interfere with young peoples life but keep them safe from anything happening to them , keep them from breaking the laws and getting in trouble by the police .My three main reasons from having a curfew were to keep them from doing anything illegal, to keep them from getting hurt or killed, to keep them from doing graffiti on buildings and walls, and makes the parent communicate with the teenager and see what they are doing .One last important thing is to always communicate with your teenager because they want your help but deep down they wont ask for it , so its important to check up on them once an awhile and see how they are doing. This is why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule . The curfew rule is an outstanding rule and I think more city councils should adopt it as well.",7,6,6,6,6,6,2576,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
318,2664,E23EF596D2B8,"I think high school offer those programs to young students that wants to graduate in early age and other students take this programs, because they want to graduate to continue with college or work to help their families. In other cases students just took these courses because they dont likes school . But however their are always students that decide to complete high school in four years to have full credits to go at the best colleges. These students that take high school in four years are more prepared to colleges and they have more probabilities to get a better job. For me take school in three years is a bad choice, because you learn a few less. Examples:If you take school in three years and if you dont have the result that you wanted than you are gonna think that was a bad choice in your life. Conclusion: students would take the traditional four years of school and enjoy the young age at school. Than after the four regular years, Its time to think about what they want to do with life work or continue with college.

True self esstem comes from achievement because you can learn faster and have advanced learning in all your classes. First, some people say that self- esstem can make you learn faster because when you work as a class and also when you work by yourself with some help from teachers yo are building up your self-esstem mostly by working alone. Self-esstem can help you at school at home and in the community too. Self-esstem can help you get good grades in school and also get a promotion by your boss at work for working hard and doing everything on time and right the first time. Self-esstem is the best thing you can have at school when you are in classes that are hard for you . Secondly, true self-esstem can get you in advanced classes so you can have advanced learning in all classes. Self-esstem can help you graduate and get in to a good collage and have a job that you love so much since you were in high school. Sometimes you need to have patience with self-esstem so you can make strong and sturdy and not weak and wobbly. Some may argue that Self-esstem comes from praising a students work to build self-esstem because it all depends on how the students work on worksheets and also on homework and how they ask for help. However, praising a students work can probably help the students build self-esstem. Unquestionly, self-esstem can come from achivement not from praising because it can help you learn faster and also have advanced learining in all classes.

320,2666,D1A866170CEA,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? There is a debate if students would benefit or not from online classes? Some people believe that students would do better if their classes are at home. I believe that you can learn more if you are in a regular class than just being at home because students can learn from other cultures or more things about life with other friends, if students do not interact with others in a future they are going to be afraid to do it, and finally if you are in a regular school you can do more activities and share with your friends. First, when you are in a school of the united states you learn a lot from other cultures. Therefore besides than world geography, you learn from your friends countries and how is to live there. Also, when you have friends at school you share your problems and most of the time you learn more things about life with them and how you can be a better person. Second, sometimes there can be shy people at school because they do not know how to interact with others or how to start a conversation. When you do activities in groups sometimes you make new friends and talk to others became easily than before. However, if students do not learn how to talk to others in public places they are going to be afraid in a future; imagine if they need to make a presentation at work, they are not going to be able to do it because they will be afraid to talk in front of all the co-workers. Learn how to interact with others is important for your future. Third, it is important to get involve in activities at school; activities help you with your curriculum when you apply to college. Also, if you are in any activity you can share more with your friends. However, when you get involved with activities at school helps you to clear your mind when you have to many homework or when you are stress out about your classes. Therefore, some of the activities give a lot of skills in the thing that you would like to do in your future. In conclusion, if students do not interact with others or neither have a friend to talk with, and they do not have activities to get involved with other people; students are not going to be successful if they try in a future to interact with a large group of people. Therefore, it is very important to learn from others and interact at your school. That is why I believe that everybody should take classes on a regular school, to learn how to get involved with others and be able to express your self.

Working alone might be boring for some people and if that person does know that they are doing the groupe could hekp them. The first reason why I think wokring in groups is more beneficial is because more than on brain think better. More then one person can help on what they are working on. They can help each other on what they need help on. Four people in a group can get things down faster then only one person. People in groups have less to do then one person because in a group everyone does something and being by yourself mean you have to do everything on your own. You also get more tired if your wokring alone and in a group your talking to one other and discusing what you are going to do. Another reason why I think wokring in gourps is more beneficial is becuase you can learn something new from another person and if your working alone you only have what you know. In a group you come up with more ideas and support them if you think they are right or wrong. If you work alone you get stressed out and if you work in a group you know what you have to do and thata the rest of your group is doing, but if they need help you can help them out on what they need. My thrid reasaon why I think working in a group is better is becuase you can support other people ideas and oppinions on what they think is better on the work. They can have a better idea then you do and might work better on the job.

322,2668,FA08CD5A2E48,"Sometimes when you are not doing anything or just do not do something physical, some good or great things could happen surrounding you and the world. My first idea that makes inactivity a ""self work"" in progress. Meaing letting people around help you instead of you doing everything yourself. A movie called ""Christopher Robin"" shows that as a child, Christopher did things before but he had imaginary animals helping him. The purpose of the movie, is to give the auidience the understanding of what it means to be always doing something, always occupy yourself with the simplest things that you do not really have to do. And adding pressure on yourself. Than letting others help you, can create good things surrounding you and you can have good thoughts. Because when you are stressed you are worried about how things will be in the future. Having people help you can still have great success that can be accomplished. The example or message in this movie shows when Christopher is an adult and he pre-occupys himself a lot, the more problems is caused with his life. He almost lost his wife and daughter because he was always occupied doing his business job. Later when he realizes he was on the wrong track, his friend, pooh was telling him he is not the same as himself before. He told himself the only way hell be less stressed and worried is to become the child inside him and bloom once more. Letting your inside child out, he needs to find himself doing absolutely nothing, no stress, and just spend time with the life he has been given and his family. After doing that, he was more gifted than before, like this idea he had for how to make his business better but had never presented because he was always doing something Like the thesis was talking about not doing something physical could lead to some good or great things, Christopher found himself at the end. He is happy and relaxed with what he accomplished when he let go and did nothing. Now he realizes the result of doing nothing and how different it would have been if he kept on occupying himself in things he should not be worried about rather than enjoying what he has to thank for. So the key is that if Christopher Robin can accomplish great or good things by doing nothing rather than doing something, then that means everybody else can learn as well the understanding to find success and move ahead.",6,6,6,7,6,6,3767,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
323,2669,1535E922B3AA,"One topic that is frequently debated today is that to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four_day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. people is discussing if school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. Some people think that this is not a good idea because if that happened students, teachers, and all staff would work more and they are going to get tired more easily. And these four days would be consider more longer than five normal days, Also maybe school would required more things to graduate and to complete these requirements it would take more time Also people think that school should have any other ideas to conserve energy without changing the days of school. for example: turn off lights when we do not need it, open the Windows etc.. I think that extending school two more hours would be very difficult for us because almost all the students have to work after school and some have full time and that required to work more that four days so if school is more long we would not complete with our jobs. And i think that if we use the energy how we have to, that would make a big difference. Also i think that if we get opinions from other people outside of the school we would have more good ideas of what to do to conserve all energy. I believe that study just four days should be more difficult to learn we probably get more easily tired because would be ten hours each day And and if we see and think if school is only four days we have to wake up more early and go home more tardy and actually the energy would be the same amount as five days there is just a little difference between five to four days of school. Also if we get tired maybe i think would be more difficult to learn. Finally to decided the best solution we need to give our opinion and discuss it. And I believe that more than one student need more time than others to learn because in my experience is really really hard to learn new things, new units, new information, and if we have only four day it make more difficult for many students. Also as we see, there is many ideas to conserve energy and very easy to catch up like in the first paragraph there are two very useful ideas how to conserve the energy, without taking away any day.",7,7,7,8,6,8,287,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
324,2670,80DD7EE85BF7,"I disagree for adding one and a half of hour in school days. Because reason #1 is that we are in school for 8 hours doing work and other thing and we get tired and its just to much forus kids or grown ups. Reason #2 is you dont have a lot of time to do your childhood things cause your in school for 9 hours and 35 mins. For example you just cameout of school your tired you what have fun but then you got to do homework and that can take hours to finish your done but you cant go outside cause its to dark and your parents wont let you cause of hours of school. Thats reason #2. Reason #3 is homework you always get home almost every single day doing some extra work and is can take hours to finish. For example you come out of school at 4:00 your tired but you got homework and then you finish your home for like 2 or 3 hoursof extra work but you cant do anything really fun like go out somewhere with freinds cause its to late and dark. Thats reason #3. Reason #4 is a appointment you always come out school at 2:45 and your appointment is at 3:00 but you cant go cause you got extra hours in school i know you can leave early but waste you child or grown up learning time in school. Thats reason #4.

326,2672,F75D6E5CCE78,"Imagine how life would feel like when you cant have your favorite food at your favorite spot in school? would it even be fun to go to school or not. About a week or two ago i went to Panda Express to grab some food on my way home but at the time that I got there, I asked to get some white rice with some orange chicken but the workers told me they have changed their menu a little bit so i cant have some,at that point i fell so sad because that was the only spot that sold some in town. I think the change of the school menu would be a bad idea because,it will make students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way,it would also bring some money problems in school and it would also make some students keep on empty stomach during the school day till they get home to prepare some food. secondly,If students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way andthey never came back, this would leave the parents worried because since the principal decided to change the menu they would have a reason for leaving school ground. Mr. principal i would be happy to tell you to leave the menu like how it is because it would make some students get in trouble and a lot of incidents will happen when they leave.0nce a bad incident happen out of the school ground,the principal would be responsible for all the damages caused when they left, keeping the old menu would be a good idea but we dont want our accidents and school detentions to increase. In addition to this it would cause some money problems because if students are going to have to eat healthy then how would they gain more money easily to support the school when they are in needs of something. This is some of the way you can make more money so, Mr principal if you decide to change it the school is going to have to shut down at a point because when is no money to operate the school and pay the teachers and custodians they would have to leave their job and get a better one and once everyone one is gone there would be any teachers to teach the students. Mr principal because of this reason we should keep the old menu so that students and teachers can enjoy their selves in the school. Therefore if the principal end up using the healthy menu this will led to some students getting sick because they will have to leave their stomach empty and they cant have what they want. This will cause a protest in the county because they supposed to eat what they like, and what the cafeteria think will be good for them to eat. In case of this of this reason the teachers will teach for no reason because the student are so focused on going home to eat what their mom or dad have prepared waiting for them,so if the principal wants them to focus in class then he is supposed to give them what they like. In conclusion i think leaving the old menu would be a good idea because if the principal wants the students to try to improve in their class then he should leave it. Therefore if the students wants to add th healthy menu on it then he should let them vote on it whether they agree on what he is saying but i would say leaving the old one should be the best for the students.

First, the world is trying to make change but you have to never have to give up. Becuase its important to continue being yourself, not matter if some people are not going to like it, the only one who have to feel comfortable with yourself its you. Second, always love and be proud of yourself. Its important to be proud of who you are because eventhough you make mistakes sometimes that doesnt have to make change who you are. You just have to learn from your mistakes, I know it is difficult but no one says that would be easy ,but you can do it. Love yourself because every of your features, your character and your personality is what identify you, is make you unique, different from anyone else in the world that wants you to fit on it.

However, plenty of students are not able to perform to the best of their ability because they have low self-confidence which is mainly caused by the lack of praise and incentive by their parents,teachers or coaches. Praising a students work is important because it helps build their confidence and motivates them to work harder. Praising a students work is vital for their productivity because it builds their confidence. Studies show that people with high self-confidence are usually risk takers,creative,optimistic,hardworking and productive. This shows how important it is for teachers and parents to praise their students. Self-confidence is not something that happens suddenly, it is a process that builds up from a young age. Little praises and incentives from parents and teachers are not only important for the students performance in school but also when they transform into adults. Additionally, another importance of praising students is the motivation for them to work harder. Students always seem to work harder when they get an incentive or praise. That is because students feel appreciated for their work and it also make them feel like they are doing a good job so they always stay motivated to do better every time. Motivation is vital for everyone because its as important as an oil is for a car. Motivation is a motor that keeps the sudents happy and hopeful. Motivated students always work hard and give their best effort. There are some people that think praising students will undrmine learning by lowering standards and some believe a true self-esteem and confidence comes from achievment and not from prasing. Although its a fair opinion, it is wrong because students who get praise from teachers and parents always seem to do better acadamically and in outside-school activities. In conclusion, Praising a students work is very important because it helps build their confidence and motivates them to work harder and smarter.",9,8,8,9,9,8,3198,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

If they want to do that the rule said is they decition,or they opioniom because they are freedom right, but i am disagree with thus rule for one reason, that its. That if they dont want to failure you have to fight for yours dreams for everythink that you can do it, and say thank u god for give me that opportunity and say i am so pround of me. you never give up just kept going and follow your dreams to have a good future and dont be failure and dont play with that things beacuse you can practice once and you can take that thing for a while of your life.

337,2683,CB71E5F9AE1E,"Do you think failure is a good thing or bad thing? Well, what a British prime minster ones said""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Some people may think this is bad thinking because of how hard you try,but you have no success at the end. Yes,i agree with the statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because of these three reasons,failure makes me better than i was at first,never giving up without motivation ,and be able to over come that obstacle that i work so hard for. My first reason, of why failure is a good thing because it makes every body better at what they started with. For example, when i first started learning how to ride a long board i was very afraid that i would fall and hurt myself. At first i really terrible and failed over and over again. Until one day my friend came over my house and showed him how i would do it. But once again i fell off my long board crazy like. Then my friend started to laugh but in a funny way,so i also stared to laugh too. I ask him why he laugh at me,he told me"" i remember at was like you when i stared to learned long board"". He also told me he was really proud of me not giving up and failing. what i understood of what he was trying to tell me is that failure can make me better from having that kind of enthusiasm in my spirit. related back to my first reason is that not just giving up,but having a motivation every time i do anything to keep going. In order to have that kind of motivation of getting out of bed and doing what you want to accomplish at the end of the day is looking up to someone who helps you get to work or hustle i can say. For example, famous people who did or was successful in life like Bill gates who found the gold rush,Arnold the best body builder of all times,and Stan lee who invited the marvel universe. All these people was in our shoes before they became famous. They can motivate us by what people probably said to them like ""no"" or ""it can not be done"". They did not listen to adorers Sayers would though that never would happen. My final reason of why failure is a good thing is to over come any obstacle that can get in your way. For example, the time when i was fifteen years old i had a problem with one of my classes in school where i had to learn to stay away from people who were not good influence on me. At first they looked like good people,but when i started to notice that they were hiding something from me i was really currouse what was it about. Until one day i was with my best friend in his room just chilling and later on he showed me on his phone what i never though they would do. I was really dissapionted what they were doing beyond my back. So on that day i had to over come my obstacle of not making friends with anybody who looks nice or their appraise. In conclusion i do agree with the British prime mister Winston Churchill quote that says ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". because of these three reasons failure makes every body better,never giving up without motivation,and lastly over coming any obstacle that can be on road to success. something that i always believed in is ""no pain,no gain"".

I believe that technology had positive effects on peoples lives because we can talk with people in long distance, working online without driving,and find new friends. The first reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives is because we can talk with our family that are not with us. Also when we missed them we can video call each other, and know about each others life. For example if there was no technology we cant talk with our families that are in long distance. And we dont know about each other, and maybe we will forget each others by the time past. Thats why technology is the best thing that we have in our lives. Everyone should have technology because its important for them and maybe something happen to you like accident and your family can find you by using their technology and find where the accident is happen. furthermore you can use technology when you are sick and you cant go to your work you can call your boss to tell him/her that you cant come today, if there was no technology it wasnt possible to do these things. Second reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives because people can work online without driving and vesting their time. Initially when you working online you can save your money and can do all of your work in your house. However thats good because if you have a children and you want to be with her/him it can help you because you can do your work and be with your child. Furthermore if you cant drive and you wish to work at home technology will help you to work online without driving long distance. Furthermore technology is good thing when you want to travel you can travel and at the same time you can work by your technology, and you can make more money. Third reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives that we can find new friends ,culture and new languages. Initially when you go to social media you can see different people with different culture and you want to know about their culture and their languages, so technology will help you to communicate with them and ask them question about their religion, country and etc. Furthermore when you going to some other country that you dont know your way technology will helps you to find your way. For example when you going to the country that you love to know about that country more but you cant ask question because you dont know the people, and their language in there, also you lost yourself in there you cant talk or ask them for help. Thats when you can use technology to helps you, you can talk with them by using your phone translator. Technology had positive effects on peoples lives technology helps people with more stuff, and they can use technology as a useful thing we use technology for everything.",6,4,6,6,5,4,3381,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

However the problem is that some people are avaricious, think that are better that others people and want all at the same time. The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money. And now He say that is not good idea leave the school for money. So theys think that are better that other people, for the society cause indifference to the other people, rejection would be also bulling. I am disagree with the thought of this type of people for example, if she/he can make something grand also the other people can the major greatness is the humility. The third reason is want all at the same time, when the author talk about ""you will never grow."" Is because the knowledge of the life is not obtain things materials amount, because in this life all is vanity if you want grow start for conform with the little that you have for example, the education help for that you will be a good person with principles.

Students think its a great idea to go to different businesses because it will be helpful to them in the future. If a student is stuck on what he wants to do in life the businesses can help them see what they want for their future. Students should have partnerships because students can get more skills about that job, students learn more about the job their going for, and student can see if that the job they really want to be in. First, students can get more skills about there job because they are in the business hands they can go around learning on how they do everything. They also get to see how the company is ran and how they handle business. Student can learn a lot we it comes to the business if the company shows them about it. If the company helps the students then the students are going to want to take classes about it. Their going to want to go to the Tech center about it their going to want to learn more. Second, is that they learn more about the business by going to the company. They learn how to control the mechanical stuff over at the company. They will learn about the paper work over there. They will even know where they want to work at over there if they learn more about it. They will have a fun experience about their job they most likely want to do when they get older. They would be even more interested to take classes at school about business and will pursue in that type of employment . Third, students can really see if they want to be in that type of business. Similar to the other two this helps them, but not only if they want to pursue in that job its for if they really dont want the job. Also they can find a back up plan if that business is not the right one for them. They can go see if its a bad business, if it helps with the future, and if its the job they want to go after.

In conclusion, The students get to choose if they want to or not. They should know what they want to or figure out what they would do in the future. Students cant be focused to do mainly anything they have to find what they like for they can do it. Other people may say that they will go there and not learn anything,however if students go there for what they are a looking for they can pursue it.

349,2695,0F7DB6BD1AD5,Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students would benefit themselfs by taking classes at home. Because they would be more focus with out anyother classmates around they would also focus more if they had a quite place to study or just do there work and students would have more time to do there work or get things done. students would focus better if they did not have a other classmate talking to them. Some students can not foucs if someone else is talking it might bother them it also might bother them if other classmates are making loud noises. For example i am one of those students that when i am taking a test i can not concentrate if other students are talking. students would have more time to study and finsh work because. They would be able to take breakes during each class. students can ask there teachers to help them study for a test or quiz they can also ask a friend to help them too. students can take a break between clases and do work for other clases. students would focus more if they had a quite place to study like the libary or somewhere they might know that would not have much noise or taking involved. students would focus better and concentrate better they will also get there work done on time. Inconclusion this is why schools should offer distance learnig for students because students would benefit themselfs to work alone with out any taking or classmates making noise. ,6,4,6,6,6,5,207,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"
350,2696,B7626C8D1FAB,"Students should start picking a career when they entered high school, so they can pick classes in school or ask teachers to help you with your career. If students start picking a career at a young age they will already have an idea of what to do, they can do research about their career at school. how much do people with your career make, what does this career do, how much do they make a year. You can even ask your parents to help you with your career by giving you some advice to help you out. The libary is a great place as well you can find books that match up with your career ask they libarians to help you find the right book. If you have an older siblings that have already gradated high school and have their career they can talk to you and help you out and to tell you what to do. School counsulers are great people to talk when your looking for a career. You can ask your counsuler any questions to help you set up a plan after you graduate high school, talk about why you choosed this career for you, do you have some experiences with this career yet, what do your parents think about this career that you want to have. Counsulers can help you look for colleges or universities that you wan to attened. You can also have your counsuler set up a meeting with you and your parents to talk and see what they can do for you. If you know anybody who has the same career that you want to have. Have a talk with them and ask he or she questions about what do you do in your job, how much does your job pay you, how much do you make a year, if they can take you where they work at and see the other employees there and have conversations with them. Its good to talk people who has the same career that you are studying for because. They have worked hard to get where they are today and they have jobs that they enjoy doing making money and living their best life. You should start looking for colleges when you are in your junior year of high school because. When you are looking for colleges you have to check how much you have to pay to attend the college, how much do you have to pay a month. Thats why some teenagers start working while they are in high school, so they can start saving money for college. Some parents pay the college for their kids, but i think its better if you pay some of that money with your parents, so they dont have to waste all of their money for you to go college. Some jobs will help you pay for the college that you will be attending at. As we read this is why i think students should start pickcing their future careers while they are in high school because.

Help other students who want to have your career as well. You can talk them to help them out, answer all the questions they have to ask you, tell them what to do you are looking for colleges to help with their career, show them where you work and show how your job is.

Another reason on why is a good idea working with in a group its a easy way to get a better garde as a group and working in a group is really fun you get to talk and use the computer sometimes the teachers let us use our phone and we make like a little group chat for us to talk about the work she told us to do and share our answers on the group chat and see who agree with it or who dont and we all got different reasons and at the end of the day we pick the support detail and use it.

353,2699,DDD3771E1DF6,"Many people believe that they do not need advises from others in order to take decisions in their life,and they believe they should take their own decisions. I do not agree with them. It is important to listen what other people think about it. Each person is different in a special own way and someone else might help you to solve your problem. I believe people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because they may have a better idea,or they may have been in the same situation before. One of the main reasons is that other people may have been there before and they may know what to do. For example, You are undecided about taking swimming classes or piano classes,and you know you are a great swimmer,but youve also wanted to play piano since you were 6 years old. Your brother have been in that situation before, and he thinks that you should take piano classes from Monday to Wednesday after school, and swimming classes every Friday after school, but you have to work from Thursday to Sunday;then he says that you should take piano classes every Monday and Wednesday after school ,and Swimming classes every Tuesday after school .You believe that is what best suits for you. Another reason is that other people might have a better or different idea than yours. Another example is that your parents give you two choices: going to Canada for spring break or going to The Bahamas for Christmas break. Generic_Name,your best friend have already visited those places and she tells you to go to Canada because she knows you love extreme low temperatures .You tell your parents that youve decided to go to Canada and once you are there you realize that it was the best decision youve taken. Thanks to your friends advise;you are enjoying your trip,and you are glad that you asked for her opinion. On the other hand,letting others influence on the decisions you take is not always the best thing to do. A simple example can be that you go to the mall and decide to buy a pair of shoes but you do not know what color to choose, so you ask your sister and she thinks that the red pair is the best for you; you buy it and when you get home, you realize that you do not like those shoes. The first thing you would probably do is blame on her because she told you to buy the red pair, but if you take that decision by yourself and you regret for the decision you make; You cannot blame on somebody else except for you. In conclusion, people who seek guidance from their family,experts, or authorities are most likely to take the right decision. All persons sometimes may need an advise from someone on what to do, or if they should follow their own instincts; but the one who will make the decision is you, so do not blame on others for the decisions you make. Humans are not perfect and we do not always take the best decisions in our life; but with help from others , we will be able to make them right and move on.",7,7,8,7,7,6,3148,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

I have many experiences,but some are impossible to change. When I came to this country and when I travel with my sister and my friends to Generic_City and my first day in the School. First, when I came to this country. This is my first impression impossible to change. When I was in my country I was happy to came to this country to look my parents and sibling. I leave of my country in October 25, 2015. I was in Guatemala for 15 day. I feeling sad, because I dont know who are the other people came in the group. After I was in Mexico for others 10 days. I not eat anything, because I dont liked the food that they gived me, also i was for anothers days in a place called Matamoros is close to the river that with to cross to came to this country.

Every day in Schood I learned somenthing different and I feeling happy. Every day when I came to the house after School I speak in English with my lilttle brother than he born here.

355,2701,2538542762C0,"One topic that is frecuently dabated is if the schools should control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Some people think that the school should take control of the students extra activities and extra time. They feel that students need more educational activities to enrich their knowledgement at school. I believe that students should decided what they want to do with their extra time after school because some students have to work to help their families, some students have to get home earlier to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work and students like to do some other activities like sports, art or homework. First, students have to work to help their parents and sibilings, it could be difficult to work and study at the same time, you get tired and all you think is get home and sleep, students who work do not have time to study for a quiz, test or do homework. However. Study hall could help them finish their homework, students who work dont get involved in extracurricular activities bacause they dont have time to make it through. But also they work for saving money for college, this is an a good idea because you are investing for your future. That is why students who work have to give up with some other acctivities that they want to do. Second, some students have to get home early to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work, most of them cant afford a babysitter, this students might have the time to involve in a club, probably when one of their parents have a day off. They can do homework or other assigments for school or home while they are taking care of their sibbilings like made food for them, clean the house, laundry etc. That can get difficult for them because they have different responsabilities at the same time that they have to take care of school. Third, other students like to do different activities like sports, they like to exercide everyday after school, there are many sports that hey can practice such as bascketball, baseball, tennis, gymnastics, etc. other students like to do art, envirroment and learn another language they can sign up for any club that they are interested on. This students are deffinetly involve in extracurricular activities from school, but they decided what they want to do with this extra time and the school do not have to tell them what should they do. As have you read this are my reasons why I believe schools should not take control of the students activities after school. When we get to know each others personal dreams and problems this world is going to change because we are going to understand how people work hard to get succes and happiness.

Another reason Having older students pair up with younger students is a very beneficial idea is that it teaches a students what skills are necessary to be a teacher just encase they want to be a teacher one day. Third reason a younger student pairing up with an older student is beneficial is because it makes the older student feel more responsible for somebody else is learning like making sure the younger student knows this like making sure he/she knows how to pronounce words correctly make sure the younger student can be organized. A fourth reason that proves younger kids pairing up with older kids is beneficial is that the teacher has a couple less students to deal with so less stress to deal with younger kids can be annoying to deal with sometimes.",6,4,6,6,5,5,3640,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"
357,2703,4E0094B179E0,"School is a time where you will receive assignments and it is your decision to complete them. Doing your work affects how teachers will think about you and how you will grow in the future. However there is one thing I disagree with in school. It is how the teachers praise students who arent giving their best efforts. I believe that true self-esteem comes from achievement and it is not right to support those who arent really trying. The first reason I disagree with the teachers method to boost kids self-confidence is because they are too dependent on others. They will look for someone to always keep them up but in a world like this you cant depend on anybody. They cant always depend on someone to help them succeed. Students can become too attach and expect to always be praised by what little they do. What would happen if their was no one to support them. They would do nothing because their wouldnt be anyone to motivate them. My second reason would be that they dont accomplish their achievements. When you accomplish a goal you have this feeling of happiness or relaxation. If students are always praised for their efforts they will never actually try to complete the task because they will have the feeling of completion. They have no reason to keep going if they seem to be done which could be a bad in the future. In the future they probably will fail their assignments because they believe that they have done good when they have but not good enough to complete it. Their are some benefits on teachers motivating students such as them gaining confidence and self-esteem. It could really help people in the future. You motivating them could later cause them to motivate others in to doing their work. I just dont want teachers to go too far and praise them for writing their name,sometimes you have to be strict. It might hurt at first in the end it will all work out. Those are some of the reasons of why I dont support teachers motivating students. Students should learn how to work alone and shouldnt ask for help. However im not discarding the option of teachers helping student. Im just saying that they should only focus on what those who really need the help. Hopefully their will be change and teachers will only help those who actually try.

Taking this situation our school principal should change our lunch to healthier food because students will not get bored eating same lunch everyday, students will stay healthy, and students will have new experience. Students at school are getting tired eating same meal every day. If our school principle change to the healthy lunch, students at school will be so proud trying new food, but some students who have their favorite cafeteria food they might have to get their food from home or try new healthy food at school. Students will stay healthy from eating healthy food. Eating same lunch everyday can be very dangerous in our life. Students are getting sick everyday and have to struggle with disease like food poison, vomiting, and so on. Changing school cafeteria food to healthy food can help many students stay healthy. Over the past years many people have died eating same meal everyday, and thats what we are doing here at school ""eating same lunch every single day"". Students who had never tried healthy food like salad, vegetable, apple and so on. For those students it will be fun experience and also some students love to try new things. Students who have their favorite food in school cafeteria, they can try new food once. Students might like those new food and be their favorite food. Eating healthy food is one of the great thing to do to satay healthy. If our school principal many people would like the food. And eating healthy food or trying new food have many advantage like stay healthy, new experience, and they will not get bored with same lunch everyday.

But others might like Community parks because theres not that many people like national parks, kids might find community parks more enjoyable because it provides a wide variety of things like Playgrounds, Soccer fields, Basketball courts, etc and its also free unlike national parks were you have to pay in order to get in. I think an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is by playing a sport like soccer, basketball etc, in a community park because you can can play there any time with friends and family its also free, you can also meet new people in a park or you can also join a sports team like a soccer team and play it with your friends which can also lead to scholarships but in order to get that you must train and work hard then you might get in to teams bigger soccer teams and you might become a Professional player and join big teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSG or other soccer teams, thats what I like to do outdoors and I think other people should stop playing video games, social media, etc and try something new outdoors because it can change your future and life for ever and playing a sport can also help you meet new people travel places, meet soccer stars from all around the world like Spain, France, United Kingdom. Sports are also good for your health running helps your heart, I also like watching soccer games I support Barcelona a team from Spain the reason why I support that team is because they have really good soccer player like Messi, Luis Suarez and Couthino and they also win trophies like the UEFA Champions League were all the European teams play every year to win the Championship. also every 4 years theres the World Cup were every Nations soccer team plays to win the World cup. In soccer if you are good at the sport and join a professional soccer team you can get paid up to more then one million! In conclusion who doesnt want to get paid one million dollars for playing an awesome sport and if youre a girl dont worry because theres also soccer teams for girls and they can also join big soccer teams and make money just like boys and its also proven that people who play sports are healthier and have better muscles they also eat healthy foods and fruits and run train every day to burn out calories so that they be in shape when they play in their soccer teams and they why i think someone might find that enjoyable.",7,7,7,7,8,7,2279,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

First and foremost, why I disagree is because you can become better. For example, you mastered a project but you want it better then what you did before look at your project closely. Write on a piece of paper on what you have then plan out your other idea. Dont make it identical make it different. Show people that you can do it but twice as better. So you can be proud of yourself and people can be proud of you too. Furthermore, why I disagree is because you should try it over and over again. For example, you mastered you project but you challenged yourself to do it twice as better. We all understand to do something better then what you already have can be a little complicated Thats why you should try it over and over again so you can accomplish it. That can help a lot to be honest you can see where you made a mistakes and not commit it again. Last but not least, why I disagree is because you should never bring yourself down. For example, people are getting so frustrated that they will say I cant no more I wont be able to do it. Thats bringing yourself down you should remain calm. Dont fell pressured at the end of the day you will do it and you will feel really proud of all of the hard work you did.

361,2707,9DA131E0F720,"Last week, I had a math test on my first period. I prepared well for the test, but on that day, I woke up late, and I realized I got late for my school. I also have missed my school bus; therefore, I had to walk the whole way to my school. I was tired and tensed. As a result, I couldnt do well in that test, but if I was taking online class, I could take the test from home and be able to not get into all this trouble. Online classes can save us from getting into all this kind of problems and save our time also. Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because sometimes, students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class, actually students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students dont want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. Those who believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. They say sometimes students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class. For example, if they get a project or assignment, some students may have trouble in understanding how to do/complete that assignment or sometimes, they might not understand a topic from a lecture in online class. However, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students dont want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time. For example, if I get sick, I dont need to miss school. I can stay at home and take my classes from home. Again, if Im not at home or may be Im at my relatives place or my friends place, Ill be still able to attend those classes. Also, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. One example is that, if I dont need to come to school to attend classes I would be able to make my own schedule and I can do my job for more hours in weekdays and save money for my college. Again, I can finish my school works quickly and take other courses which can help me in my future career or, may be I can do some other activities I like. In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students dont want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities.

Although some people think that a positive attitude will not help a lot help a lot to be successful, actually that is not true. A positive attitude is the key to success because, we can always be out of stress and bad thoughts, we can always have a high confidence about ourselves and for something good to happen, and we can always have a good and friendly personality wich makes others to feel good about helping us and we can use their experiences in our lives. Here are some reasons that explain why a positive attitude is the key to success. the first reason, is we can always be out of stressand bad thoughts. For example, when we are in the bad situation and we dont know what to do, if we have a negative attitude you will be filled with bad thoughts and anxiety, we cant think properly and find the right solution. The second reason, is we can always have a high confidence about ourselves and for something good to happen. For example, if you are studying for our test, and if you have a high confidence and you are certain that you will pass the test, you will absolutely pass it. And last but not least the third reason, is we can always have a good and friendly peronality which helps others to feel good about helping us.

We have been talking about the benefits of having a positive attitude and how is helpful for us to slove our problems and have a healthy mind.

363,2709,05CE0C0C5102,"Is it a good idea for student to finish high school in three years? Well I think that if student take three years to high school is that they know what they want to do in their life. Those student either want to go to college early, go the the work force, or start something from their passion. I am going to talk about three things of what I think about this prompt. Those things are students knowing they want to do in their lives, student not knowing what to do in their lives, or student just want to be done with school. Student that take a three year high school plan, know what to do after those three years are up. They are determine to finish high school so they can finally start learning something that they have wanted to do. In those three years student are willing to finish any assignments on time and will at least get As on their grades. They use their time wisely and always focus something to get it done. Once those are out of their way they are ready for the next step in their life. Most students take a four year high school because they want to take time of what they want to do in their lives. The reason is, is that students just do not know what they want to do. Students just do not know what interest them so they have a hard time of their whole life. Some students just know what they want to do, but do not want to take a three year high school because it can be to stressful for them. most student will finish high school and can continue to college wandering what to do. If a student ether take a three or a four year high school maybe just want to be done with school in general. those students may just think that college maybe just not worth the time, some just dont have the money to pursuing college. Those student may just know what to do and know that college is just not needed for that and is just a waste of time. They could have the resources already to pursuit the things that they want to do and so they are prepared for what is coming. To put it all together, make sure choose what is best for you wither it is a three year high school plan, or a four year high school plan. In those years student have got to prepare for them selves if they are taking a three year there is going to be a lot of work being done so they can graduate early. For the students who are taking a four years for high school got to use their time wisely and think about what they want to do during those years. I feel like what is the best option is a four years of high school because i dont want to do a lot of work in three years. so that is what i think about this prompt, four years of high school is good enough for me.",7,7,8,7,6,8,78,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

But like John Lubbock says "" your character will be what yourself choose to make it"". I agree with John Lubbock because is important that you have to choose what will be your character traits and this are my reason. Firts reason is you create your own personality. The second reason is the you are not monotonous. And the last reason having others people respect. When we create our own personality is means in a group of friend we are the funny, the serious, or the person the never pay attention what the other friend is saying ( that is me I never pay attention what my friends is seaying). Have your own personality is important because that is what make you unique when dont permit the other people influeneces with idea. When a person is monotonous is they dont a different way to do the work they always is going to do the same every single thing for example in art class the teacher make a painting of a sundown and then they have to the same painting all the student is gonna put their own style to the same painting but this student is make a replica of the teacher work he dont put a different style or a different color. Some people may says that be differentof the other people is no important. However having your own personality is very important and that is my tird reason, having your own personality can get other people respect and some is gonna says the why you are talking about. Well get respect from the others people with your personality can be healthfull because when you are good leader the workers respect you and they work more and if you still confesed well let me ask you if you work with boss the is always angry and he is always yell you will be confortable to work ( I dont belive) or your boss is always making jokes you know to be ""cool"" you will respect him (I dont believe).

366,2712,7E29ACA46157,"Summer vacation is a good break for the students to spend time with their family, also a good way to take a break form school and your annoying classes, to take some rest, change your mind, and think about what will you change, when you go back to school, also taking a long summer vacation will get yourself out of stress. you will be able to do other think than just memorizing stuff you dont need in a real life, thats why its not a good idea to reduce students summer break just because educators say so, we need to have some fun and start learning new stuff about the path we want to take in our life. First of all taking a long summer break will restore ourselves, it will change our personally there might be people that are devastated from getting bullied at school, some people that have stress and dont want to talk about it and need some time to think about it, some that fail the SOL,and are failing a class, and never want to repeated again, or get ready for summer school, some that need to get ready for the next school year. we need time to do all those stuff and make our life better, when we come back from summer vacation. Summer vacation also give us the opportunity to get a job and save money, two months is pretty enough to get you at least much money. Some students that take care of themselves need to have more time to get ready for the next school season, so they can buy what they need such as: school supplies,clothes, ETC..... summer vacation need to be long enough so we can spend time with our family. school is not our family but home, the only reasons most students come to school this day are to make new friends. Second think school is worthless, we dont need to go to school for that long what we need is to work hard to achieve our dream, and have some fun with life, thats all we need, and if we stay in school for a year and spend less time at home, we will not be able to communicate well with our family, this is not a good idea, there are people that went to school, and got their high school diploma, went to college for 2 years, and are still working at McDonald for few money, that means they just waste a lot of time at school this whole year and didnt get any good from it, so if we stay at school for a year, we will then spent 12 year getting educated, and still not achieve our dream, still going to have a job at a fast food restaurant. we need a longer break so we can recover form school stress and spend time with our family, school now last for 10 month and summer vacation last for 2 months and a half, so we should leave it like that. Third thing is taking off one week off spring break and fall break is really a bad idea, why because we need to have some rest and some fun. who want that, no one want a week off spring break and also a week off fall break. what, thats insane, we are going to do a year at school and get only a total of 1 months off out of 12 months what, no, that is a bad idea, if we get a year of school , how are we going to get 3 week or 4 week of summer vacation there will be no summer vacation. School start in September and finish in June so, when we will have a year of school we will be finishing in August that make 12 months of school, so where is the summer vacation break. so some people might disagree with me, but i think that what we should do is change the school system. so lets say some students like school and want to get to the higher level. im sure that they have families and have to rest. for example; lets take a place of a student that want to be a athlete, and is learning math, science, economics, and other stuff for 12 years without getting any lessons from the the types of athlete he want to be, so thats kind of bad and not good, why because getting educated for something you dont have any interest in or you dont like at all, its not good. we can say math might help you a bit, but not everybody want the same things, also not getting a long break will weaken our brain. Every country have the same system break as us, not all but at least FRANCE has the same as the U.S, by changing our break time it might affect other countries, students will have more stress and will not have fun at home with their family, parent might also complain about changing the break and going to school for a year, by the way every time we come for a new school season we learn new things and different things, At least half of what we learn just come in some of the topic, we will not have the same class as last school season, but new one and new different topic, you will only have the same stuff to learn, if you fail the class or if you the SOL in that class, and thats why we need a longer break so we can focus more on that in the break time and wont fail no more next school season. Family over school, family is the most important thing, im dont know anyone that dont like his families members, so lets said that we should not reduce the school break, or go to school for one year, we should also change the school system so we can put students in what they are trying to become the future they want to build, the future might need more people that could do a lot of different stuff, we might need help for, then lets agree that going to school for one year is not worth it for some students and reducing the summer vacation is a bad idea.",6,7,6,7,5,6,1662,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

For example, if there is two guys on a job interview and one of them show a positive attitude while are asking him questions but, the other person is answer all the question with a bad attitude, the person with a positive attitude will get the job because, a good attitude show who you really are. Showing a positive attitude can really show where you came from and how your parents educate you. Other wise, if a person show a bad attitude and he is insulting all the people and his way that demonstrate that his parents didnt gave him a nice education. Because, the attitude came from how your family had teach you to respect the people. A nicely attitude can even help in the education. In other way attitude is the most important key in education because, nobody will teach someone with a bad education. It is important to demostrate a positive attitude when a teacher is explaining something because, that way you desmostrete the techer how much effort you are putting in the education and that you really want to success in your life.

369,2715,911DD337DD61,"In my opinion, students should take electives instead of music, drama, or arts. Some students may dislike to be in music or drama because they dont have experience to be singing or drawing. They should focus on what they are good at for themselves. One reason that students should take electives, they will pay attention to their classes and finish up their work to get the credit. Some students cant multi-task if they do drama class and math at the same time. They would have to focus on the important things that theyre good at. Students shouldnt be wasting time on taking drama or music classes because they may not be interested in doing those classes. Itll be easier for the students to learn more with their assignments, instead of worrying about arts or dram classes. For example, during in my junior year, the school wanted me to take art and music. I never wanted to take art because I knew I would be awful at drawing and fail the class. I had to take music also, I was horrible playing the guitar and I was failing in that class. Ive told the teacher that I couldnt take art nor music because I wasnt great at it. I just wanted to focus on my course classes, so that I can graduate and get pass all my classes to graduate my year. Second reason that students shouldnt take it, they will finish with their course classes and will get to graduate their year. Its hard when some students cant do what others can do at drama or musics. Itll be the best opportunity for the students to focus and work hard on their course classes. They should not worry about the electives because that can be done at the end of the year. They wont have to stress about their grades to be below F if they dont take the electives. They wouldnt stress about taking electives and course classes at the same time because itll stress them out. Last reason, students shouldnt take advantage of making themselves work more as they are now. They should only worry about their course classes because those are the only classes that will make them graduate. Some students have no talent or experienced to do art or to be in musics classes. Its better for them to finish their course classes and then at the end, they can take their electives.

Although many people say that there are better ways to influence others than just with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples, actually the best way to influence others is setting a good example on your own behavior because it shows that you were capable of doing it no matter how hard it was for you and yet you still did it and also you will inspire other people to do their own example based on your ideas.

Actually, the best way to influence other is not being someone important in society but setting a good example on your own behavior. It will show that that even though it was hard for you to do your example, in the end you still did it. That show that no matter who you are or where you come from as long as you have determination you will achieve your goals. Look at Barack Obama for example, hes a black man and yet he still managed to become president of the United States. That really had a huge impact in the black community and inspired many of them to work hard for their goals. Also, you will inspire other people based on your own ideas. An article on New York Times shows that most of the people based their ideas on other peoples examples, which means that if you continue working hard to achieve your goals you will appear on one of those articles and will inspire others. Think about it, wouldnt you like to hear that one person gave you credits because became successful because he read about your experience and he based his ideas on that experience of yours? In conclusion, many people will say that in order to influence others you need to become somebody important, but you know what? That doesnt matter! As long as you have determination and great creativity you will achieve your goals and will inspire many people to follow their dreams no matter how much it will cost them. Like Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" It doesnt matter what people say, the one that has the power to inspire others is you!

371,2717,ED06CD30103F,"Have you ever wondered when is it a good idea for people to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. They are many reasons why high school kids need to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. Im going to tell you why it is a good idea for high school kids to have a (an) idea of what they want to do for a living. However, some people think its a bad idea for them to start thinking what they want to do for a living. If people dont start knowing what they like at a young age then they will not know what the want to do in the future. We should start knowing what we want to do by the end of high school for many reasons. When we finish high school we should go straight to college so we can study about what we want to do. Theyre many people in the world that still dont know what they want to do; and that is because they didnt know what they want to do. You should always know what you want to do for a living once your out of high school. People in high school only think about living life and not thinking about what they want to do fro their life. Theyre many people in high school (including me) that just want to live life with out a job and just got party. Life doesnt for that way. If you want to work at McDonald, Burger king, etc the you wont be able to party like you want. All your going to do is work, work, and work all day. If you start think about what you want to do for a living right now, then when your older you wont be working all day. You will be able to take a vacation or have time with your family. Some people think that if you wait until your an adult to know what you want to do, then its better, but thats not what I think. You should know what you want to do by the end of high school. Then when your older, like in your 50s or 60s then you can retire and not bust your butt of working at a minimum wage job for your whole life. Thats my reasons why I think its better to know what you want to do for a living once your in high school.",7,8,7,7,8,6,3464,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
372,2718,AB142AA123BC,"As we all know, students love summer break. but what if they were to take that long summer break we once had and make it into a 3-4 week summer break! I would be beyond upset and I bet other students will too! Personally I dont think its a good idea. But who am I to judge other peoples opinions. So im going to just state some reasons why this not a good idea. First Reason is that many students want a long break from school. And I mean a LONG break from it. The reason to this is because, we get stressed, tired, drowsy, and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year around. And this can cause depression in teens as well, and trust me I know that feeling it sucks. But anyways back on topic. And for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea but it just doesnt make sense to me in my opinion. Second Reason is that students spend more time with family and friends! The reason for this is that students dont have time to spend time with them because there either doing school work or there to tired to even talk so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are. And when you are tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so its better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because, all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that. Final Reason is that summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year. A nice 3 months without work, stress free, relaxation, and do whatever you want and 3-4 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax. And when September arrives it will be a fresh start and are minds will be clear and ready again too do more work. In conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is.

But, Not all the schools has these benefits and also because some students dont have how to go to these schools and all of us students do not can go to any high school. I think thats the only bad thing because if you drive, you just can go and then back your home and some times if someone is giving to you ride is good as well but its not gonna be every time then you would have to find who can take you to school and who can pick you up from the school. Well I think we the student to commit to a career at a young age is well because we can be graduated more early. the good news is if you go to thats schools you can learn more and choose what do you wanna study for college thats a good point and also you may have a lot of opportunities, In some high schools you needed have good grade for going there and passing clases too. in others words if you dont have a good grades you cant sign for that schools.

375,2721,C7CE778367F6,""" Why stay home bored out of your mind when there are enjoyable ways you can spend outdoors? "" I think outdoors activities are more enjoyable then indoors activities because you can spend more time with family, spending more time exploring the world, and take time away from all those electronic devices. Being outdoors provides a wide variety of interesting ways to enjoy being outdoors for example going to the park where there awesome activities for the kids and parents, taking a stroll outside with you dog or family, and it can also be a stress reliever. First, Family is important, and spending more time with family is important, because it allow you to get to know them. For example your mom and dad work really hard to affords all the stuff you need and you and your brothers and sisters are barely able to see them. On Saturdays and Sundays are the only time your able to see them and have quality time with them but you are to busy in your room chatting with friends a d doing your homework, but all you have to do is take a break and spend time with them. Going to the park with them , walking around, talking have a nice conversation without a rush, joking around are ways you can spend time with family. Having fun at a carnival or festival with your family, eating hot dogs, cotton candy , riding fun rides, you might even find your cousins there and also spend time with them. All of these are enjoyable ways you can spend with your family outdoors. Secondly, spending more time with the outside world is an amazing experiences because it allows you to discover all the amazing living creatures, food, cultures, countries , other ways other people live, etc. It can be very enjoyable to explore for example you can go to South Africa there are amazing food, animals if you go to the zoo its amazing, and fun to do with family or friends or even alone. Exploring can also be fun you can go out meet people you can go to book fairs, concert from your favorite bands or singers, try out different restaurant, try something crazy like jumping from a cliff and going into the river, swimming with sharks or dolphins, you can meet people who might be with you your whole entire life, have connections with them, visiting a museum, a aquarium. There are fun ways you can explore the world with all these outdoors activities. Thirdly, spending time away from electronics helps enjoys quality times with other for examples your family, friends,and it helps be more focus in school and homework. Humans have tendency to procrastinate and be like "" oh im going to do my homework and this or that tomorrow I have so much stuff to do"" but at the same time stay on there phone for hours. Some people cant even have a decent conversation with family or spend time outdoors with their brothers and sister because they are too busy on their phone for hours. Parks, museums, and other places have good outdoors activities that helps humans stay away from technologies. There and millions of ways you can enjoy outdoors activities without being on your devices. In conclusion, going to the park with your family and spending time together, visiting different countries, taking time away from your phone, and enjoying all the beautiful things this earth has, are enjoyable ways you can spend outdoors, all of the activities can also be a stress reliever, going to the park with your cousin and sibling are fun to do and are enjoyable time outside .",7,6,6,6,6,6,2716,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

377,2723,74FF4379012C,"BEING YOURSELF. Being yourself is by far the most fulfilling accomplishment any individual would have ever made. Not only does it take a lot of confidence, devotion, and self acceptance, but also the ability to learn, understand and love yourself both internally and externally. people tend to have different role models for various reasons, for example my younger sister always wanted to be like the famous singer Beyonce because she had a beautiful voice. They might have some things in common which draws them closer to the idea of being just like them. Little do they know that them turning out exactly just like their role models is almost impossible because they lack their unique personality traits and acquire their own completely different set of traits which makes them who they are. The sooner people realize that each individual is unique in one way or another the better. Being yourself does not mean breaking the rules because you like it but doing the right thing in your own unique way. Not only does that stand out but also makes you feel good about yourself. A perfect example would be comedian Liza Koshy from YouTube who made a whole career out of being unapologetically herself while she did comedy!.Using her as inspiration would be healthier than aspiring to be just like her. With that I conclude that being yourself is not necessarily a walk in the park but putting effort into it would make a bigger difference than following the crowd. Ideas lead to actions and by visualizing yourself doing things correctly but in your own way is killing two birds with one stone! Author Waldo Emerson was right about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else being the greatest accomplishment.

My dad once told me that whatever you do in life and even if you fail you should always tackle it with a postive attitude no matter what. Having a positive attitude has great benefits when it comes to work place,your personal business and even life in general, being rude or disrespectful to people wont pay, there is a saying that says what goes around comes around, so if you treat people with a negative attitude, in the near future somebody will treat you the same way. Attitude is very important in life, attitude determines if your going to be a better person in life or a bad person, attitude determines how well you are in treating people with respect. A good attitude goes a long way, even if you dont have enough money or you struggle to pay your bills having a good attitude and being postive will land you into a good job and also by meeting great people. Having a bad attitude can even ruin things that you know how to do well, if your suppose to be doing something and you do it with a bad attitude it wont turn out good, you will always end up doing something wrong because of your attitude. At the end of the day attitude counts, treating people with respect is very important and it will take you places you have never thought about.",7,7,7,8,8,8,3414,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
379,2725,CB4C85EFAE67,"The author Waldo Emerson wrote a statement or quote that it say ,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" basing on my point of view or experiences, I agree with him, I think the same, we will never grow if we keep doing the samething that we already mastered. Im taking this position on this issue becasue I have my reasos to sopport my position and to explain why this author is right. First reason is on point of view if youre already mastered in something and youre keep doing it , to be better or go beyond then my opinion is that youre wasting your time on something unnesesary because youre already mastered , just be happy with what you have and knows a sample are the Childrens they always wanna something if they have it they want more and more or when they are playing they wanna play possiblely the all day when they realize the day is already gone but they dont care because they think that they have enough time to play so it is the same with us. sometimes we wanna be betters than another people or just feel good but were wasting our time in somethin that we already mastered. Secondly the author Emerson show us the true in a quote we can stop doing something that we already mastered we could try to do something else or try to learn something new that can help us in the future of that way we can start growing because we start to learn about differents things so we have more knowledge and we can survive and we can realize or knows how the life looks like. A sample to be a boss you need to know or have more knowledge at least than yours employs or to be amanager you have to know many things. Finally unless you try to do it better or be better than the rest of the people always is gonna be someone else who is better than you then that time youre wasting doing something beyond than you knows ,use it to teach someone else or learn about some else how to be better in something , teaching someone else or learning from someone else you can start to grow. A example is a old brother he learn about his parents and also teach and care his youngest brother of the way he is starting to growing up because his taking a responsability .The example can show us that we need to about experiences or advices or people who has more knowledge of that way . In conclusion for these reason and supporting with examples that I wrote, I agree and think the same with The author Waldo Emerson , I took this position because If we try to do something beyond what we already mastered, we will never grow. Also we wasting our time and we could use that time to learn from someone something else what we do not know or teach to someone else about our knowledge . what we can help us to grow or be better in the future concluding I agree with Emersons statement.",6,6,6,6,5,7,2774,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

381,2727,A43F5C97F2E2,"A lot of a good workers are doing all their best to find new jobs and a believing future for themselves , most of them are responsible and confident that they can do anything to make the work up and even more better than it before , but they usually dont find it because they dont have experiences and these employers dont want to hire them just because of that . Although, a lot of people may argue that employees may need experience to find jobs but actually none of that is right .Theres a lot of people that found jobs and succeed without experience , you just have to keep believing and never give up. My father didnt found a job too and he is mom was sick and he had me as his son so young . He had no experience in any domain and he needed a job pretty badly to pay the rent and grandmas surgery . But he tried again and again and he never gave up and now he is one of the most famous journalists in Morocco without any experience and still better then the one that do have experiences. First of all ,an employee doesnt need experience to find a job , he just need to be loyal to his job and work hard and be such an honest person to make his work go even higher and help spread love and respect at his job to all the people . Second , its not necessarily that it has to do with jobs obviously ; it can be acting or sports or anything you want to do .You dont certainly need to have experience to do it just like Mohamed Ali said :Everyone start out as a beginner "", but in term of jobs you just have to show your employers how much you deserve this job and that you can be a better candidate to hire . But you need to prepare for it thought because you dont want to look like a person that can not bring the job up and that you dont know anything about it. My father told me that mostly the workers that dont have experiences are the ones that work hard and always bring ideas that push the job even higher and they usually have positive attitude and a positive vibe that makes the boss love them more then the other employees. Third, I dont know why all these employers dont give a chance to the employees just to see what they can do , theres a lot of people that didnt even got a chance to show their work , even thought they can be the best at it .I have a french friend that wanted to be a teacher assistant for a french class here in the United States of America , but all the schools didnt accept her as a teacher because she didnt had much experience in teaching and that is just not fair .She is french and she can teach better because she is from the country where the language is coming from and thats how the students will learn pretty easily , thats why I believe that the employers should change their opinion about the experiences. Finally , It really doesnt matter if you dont have experiences because if you believe in your self it means that you can get any job you want , just keep the hard work and all these employers that still think that experience is necessary will regret it after because they will see you at the top . For me , experience have nothing to do with jobs everything depends on the work youre going to do and not the work you have done , and Im pretty sure that the persons with no experience will rock it more than the ones that do have experiences and just keep in your mind the positive energy and youll make it just like my father did and my french friend did .",7,6,8,8,6,7,2203,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

In addition, you have to think about your ideas. Forexample, when I know the position of superviser is avilble at my work and traying to work harder and harder to get this position,but after three years of working hard they gaive this position to someone ealse at this time i feel failure and I keep asking my self why they did not give me the position. Moreover, after two month the manager taking to me about why I am not working hard same like before, and you telling him about the superviser position and you did not ask me for it you just give it to someone ealse. Socend, the city manager called me to ask me if I am still interstiing about the postion or not I said yes I am intersting for it. Then he meet me at the work and said to me to get the position you have to do a lot of things before I gave you the position I said a lot of things like what, I am always dowing every thing at work. Third, he said I have to work all the positions in the reastorant the positions are the following:Foodrunner, Host,Selver,and Ketchen. And after all of that you will get a traning of two other restorants. In addition to that, I have to disid if I still need the superviser position or not, if I said yes I still need it thats mean I heve to do all the thigs what the manager said it to me to gt the position. FOrth, I accept my manager ofer, and i worked all the positions in the restorant accept the bartnder. Fivth, the superviser position is good I will get good money and indepence on the location of the restorant our location in Washington Dalles International Airport.

Moreover, I am working with the campany since the open the restorant I am the seniorest preson in the restorant because the campany changed the manigment three times until now.

389,2735,827D807512AB,"churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Success consists of going from failure without loss in enthusiasm. I think that churchills is wrong about that failure of the plays in the pursuit of success because not many people are failure of there success and many people are in inspired from what they are going and so many people are pursing a failure. Firstly, not many people are failure of there success. For example people that are failure is not succeeding in doing something else. Lets say that student that goes to school that they dont want to succeeded in there education. That they dont want there education for college or a university if they dont succeeded . Another example is if you are not succeeding then you cant do something just as outcome. Secondly, many people are inspired from what they are going to succeeding. For instance people are are working or getting a job they have to be inspired of there job they have to succeeded in what they are going. They have to love they job or do a better to succeeded in there job. If you succeeded in your job you might get a raise. Thirdly, so many people are pursing to failure. They dont want to pursuit anything because if they do then they are not succeeding in doing something else. for example if a students want to graduate on time with there class mates they he has to get good grade pass the sol then he has to succeeded in school. They have to be enthusiasm meaning they have to be inspired. Iin conclusion Winston churchhills is a failure of the plays in the pursuit because not many people are failure that who want to success and many people are inspired from want there are going and finally so many people are pursing to failure.",7,6,7,6,5,6,1721,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

393,2739,4FD4CE18CCDF,"I think seeking multiple opinions would be better, because you can actually view multiple perspectives and then decide which one is the best. For example, you can make a list of pros and cons to see which one you like the most. Or, you can take a vote on what to do. You will also be able to listen better and be more supportive of other people. You will as well as compromise better with multiple people rather than one specific person. For example, lets say someone wants a dog. He or she is going to have to listen to many peoples opinions about having a dog. One person could say, ""Having a dog is a very big responsability. So dont get one unless you ready to take on the risks for it."" Another person could say, ""Its really easy to own a dog. All you have to do is feed it, wash it, play with it, take it out on a walk, and clean its mess."" After he or she listens to both people, he or she makes a pros and cons list and decides which side has more and which one is the best. Another example, someone wants to play a sport, but it can be too dangerous. One person says, ""Dont do it. Its not worth risking your life and slowly dying in the hospital."" Another person says, ""Do it! Its not only fun, but it can also help you be more cooperative and you are being active."" Again, someone can agree with both answers, so thats why people need to compromise, to both get what they want. One example of a compromise, you want to watch the new movie Billy Madison. However, you are underage. It can work out if you ask someone if he or she has ever seen the movie. If yes, ask he or she if theres any scene okay for your age. If yes, you will probably be able to only watch the movie once. Otherwise, you are goind to have to wait until youre at the age. Another example is, you want to stay up. However, your parents never let you. You can talk to them and see if they can let you stay up for at leat just one night. If youre lucky, you will probably be able to stay up during the weekend. But never on a school night. Thats why I think seeking advice from multiple people is a better choice. Not only it will help you more, but, it can also teach you how to deal with real-life situations. Also compromising and making a list will help you with that. It will as well teach people how to listen better and be more supportive of others. Then you decide whether if its right or wrong.

394,2740,CEE41F7526FA,"I have some reasons why I would disagree with the school board because I dont like the idea of staying more time in school. Either way it is not a good idea because the school would face alot of work with the time extended plus its gonna be more work than ever with the school extending. And I have a lot of reasons why its a bad idea so I guess start the reading the paragraphs right now. First extending the school day would get a lot of students mad at the school because they want to go home and do whatever they want. The students would have to stay longer in the school and some would be mad and some be happy about it. And students that are bulllies would have a bigger chance on picking on people during the extended time of school. The next day the school would most likely be getting emails from students and parents complaining about the extended school day. While other students and parents wont care and go to school like a normal day and al lot more. Also the jobs in the school could change like the teachers job and other jobs in the school time would be extended. Some teachers would complain by the extended school day if there gonna do a extended day everyday they are gonna have to be payed more or else the school would die slowly because all teachers,staff and other jobs in the school would quit and go work somewhere else better and get paid more. If one teacher does quit their job because of the extended time he/she would most likely tell other people that the school is terrible then the school would barely get people to work there and in a couple years later probably the school would be abandoned for other people to explore to see the leftovers of the dead school. Finally the school would change by alot than before it ever has in its couple years of existance. The school would have to face a lot of consequnces like a lot of students posting on the internet about how the school is trash,boring and now they want to go to a different school. And the teachers would complain about if they are going to teach more than ever they want to get bad even more money. And they would have to change the whole school time of the day,the bus time and the students classes time which would took a very long time to do. Either way other jobs in the school would be more difficult than ever for example janitors,staff and teachers. Even though the school really does want to change original time to a extended time its not the smartest idea in the world because theres gonna end up being consequnces to it and they are not going to be fun for anyone. Either way next thing you know the county that owns the school will just die because of the extended day. Because then who knows probably no one then later on wants to go the either school in the county anymore and would probably just moved out to go to a better school. So this is why this idea is a bad idea. ",6,6,6,5,6,7,2847,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
395,2741,4FD5B8B612C6,"Does going from failure to faliure consist of success.? It does , a lot of people in their life have failed to do something in life for example: failed a test ,failed to do a work assignment ,failed to show up to work once or twice, ect. You can fail a test , fail to show up to work but you get an opportunity to fix that mistake but some people just dont care about that opportunity. Say you were to get a 75% on a math test but you wanted to get a better score you did study, but didnt show up to class , or stay after school to get extra help. So then you ask the teacher if you can re-take the test and the teacher say that you can but you have to show up to class ,and stay after if needed extra help ; because without studying, or showing up to class ,ect. How will you pass the math test or any test if you dont study . Its okay to fail and fail no one is perfect not everyone is going to get it right the first time unless you just have goodluck but still you have to study for a test no matter what.

It was time for the show; you guys finished and did a wounderful job playing the music and did an amzaing job for your solo part.

Some students wanna do online class and night school to help them graduate and get there GPA for there classes for college. Do students do online classes and night school right now? Tutoring and and night classes and can help with everything you need in college. Students that graduate early helps you to get ready for college. This helps all the opportunity for them to understand the learning. The classes you do to understand all the things that happen in each course to help out all. For example, I know a lot of people that that do classes in the morning and at night time to catch all the work for the classes they hard. The more work you get done during summer it counts your GPA scores. Doing everything done with work at school can get ready for everything to be done. Do students do online classes and night school right now? If so, how do students get it done with all the activity and what programs they do to make it done.

Being orgizinize with all the work you do in school can help you with all the work you will do in college this is you being independent for everything you do in high school because teachers helping you out. For me being a high school students all the elective classes I do helps me with the course Im taking in college and doin online classes was the best way to get it done. Programs you make in school and trying to be in it will help you with all the work you have. Early gradutes, yes, theres alot of them in the country to just get there education done with everything. Colleges do look at your scores and work you do with all the information you do in school all the records and everything. Having good grades and always in school thats one of the records to make college look at you and be like I want her to know to be in my college.

397,2743,62243789233B,"In todays society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self. Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so. Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks dont turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve. Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve. A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.",6,7,8,7,8,8,1280,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who dont have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework.

I rather be on my regular school schedule. If Generic_School extend the school hours, kids would have more time to run the halls and skip they classes. By adding extra hours to our regular time , kids will have more time to get in trouble or get suspended. School shouldnt be no more than 7hours long. Every students should go to school on time so they can get out on time. Extending the school hours is really unnecessary. Kids shouldnt stay in school for extra hours if they got to go to school for a whole week. School should just let out on regular time so the students could go home and get some rest. We should never have to stay in school for extra hours unless if its snowing outside. So its best that we stay on our regular school schedule and not add extra hours.

In my opinion having a positive attitude helps you to be a parent because the childrens get scared from the person whos always angry and frustrated. thats why most of the parents hide thier nerves and they act nicely infront of the child. Couple relationship consider attitude because most of momen prefer the guy with a positive view and whos open for evryone.

405,2751,ECB127F00953,"I disagree, I think if you are honest all the time, you might say some mean things to a person, which might hurt their feelings. First, being honest is good, thats how you earn trust. However, keep some things to yourself if you think its not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if youre honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said. Firstly, there isnt a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say whats right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if youre not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person. Secondly, If you are honest ""all the time"" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that ""honesty"" and ""truth"" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot. Lastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you dont know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too. In conclusion, I disagree with ""Honesty is the best policy"" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

406,2752,F7E091B1D163,Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble? In this essay I will discuss as to why curfews could be a necessary law for teenagers. One of the reasons curfews could help out parents keep their children safe is that teenagers like to hangout with friends late at night and having a curfew for teenagers could prevent them from getting in some sort of trouble. Another reason why curfews could keep teenagers more safe is teenagers think they know everything in this world but in reality they dont know how the world really is and anything can happen at any certain time. The finale reason why I think some teenagers need to have curfews is because some teenagers are still not mature enough to be out late at night and something could possibly happen to them. I think the 3 reasons listed above is more than enough evidence to have curfews for teenagers to keep them safe and to keep parents aware and calm for their children. As a parent or guardian of a teenager we all want to keep our children as safe as possible because anything could happen outside our homes. In concussion I think the 3 reasons listed above is more than enough evidence to have curfews for teenagers to keep them safe and to keep parents aware and calm for their children. As a parent or guardian of a teenager we all want to keep our children as safe as possible because anything could happen outside our homes. Curfews can be good thing to keep parents aware of what their children are doing but I personally think they should not be a law for every teenager. For example some parents they are OK with letting their child to be out late at night but as long as they stay in contact with a parent at all times. That shows that not every teenager in this world is irresponsible and is aware for their own actions. ,7,6,7,8,8,6,3716,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
407,2753,FE4E3BB2DAE1,"People really work on this this? or People knows the importance to be better every day? People didnt know the importance to learn more, like give to their mind more wisdom and they just conform with small pieces and I very agree with this statement because its true that if you dont learn more than you already know, you dont be able to be successful in life and I was wrong all the time and its sad for me just realize that I waste a lot of time doing nothing and this question makes think a lot and the reason why is because I never think about to do something much better that I did already and sometimes if I have to do it, Im afraid to fail or do something wrong but small things do the difference and know something more that you already do it gives you more opportunities in life and you grow more. Try something new that you never done before its something scary for humans it doesnt matter the age or how brave you are, if you had a lot difficulties doing it; probably you will be scare if you have to do it again even if you already know how to do it for example, I been working in a Japanese restaurant about one year and half and it was the first time for me working as a server and I was scare to do it and the reason why I decide to do it was the money, and I got surprise of myself because I made it and my boss was telling me that I was doing really good job and I felt so proud of my self because at that time my English want perfect and after Im got problems with him about money and it was too much problems, so I decide get another job my friend told me that her boss was looking for new servers so I went to apply but the problem was when I saw the size of the restaurant and the different with the other restaurant was a lot and also when I saw the menu in mind I was saying "" You will fail"" I feel too bad that day, and all the progress was long and suffering for all the mistakes that I made but I made it one more time and today I thinking all that I went through it wast that much difficult and Im not a master but Im still learning. Many people are conformist with their life and dont want to learn more and unfortunelly Im include in that group of people and it happens to me that I fail many times because I think already know everything even more than others for example, One day I was taking a Spanish test and felt confident about it because my first language is Spanish and I remember the majority of my classmates were studying for that test but wasnt and I fail the test because I saw questions that I never imagine that even exist and that was very important to get a credit so that day I learn that even if know many things is always good learn more. In conclusion, you have to be better every day and know that is always more to learn every day, even if you know the stuff and always keep in your mind that try something new dont have to scare you because every human has the ability to learn and do the much that they want and the only obstacle you put it to your self.

408,2754,FF7FE6BD8509,"I agree that first impression is almost impossible to change. No matter what you always want to stand out of the crowd and show the best of you. People are always going to think of you of how you first were when they met you. The first impression isnt just about you acting in a certain way. Its also about you showing them your character but most important to get them thinking good things about you. I have three examples of why first impression is important. My first example is that Generic_Name wants his parents to meet his girlfriend. He thinks thats her first impression of how she acts or on how she greets her self towards them is something his parents are going to be looking at. Most Guys like Generic_Name want their girlfriend to have a good first impression so their parents like her. Then second example is on the first day of school teachers always want to give their students a good first impression about them. Either on how they teach or how smart and fun they are or anything so the students like them. Last but not least my third example is when a school goes on a field trip to a museum or to another school. They want to have a good first impression on any other school thats there or anyone one because, youre representing your school. There are people who believe that first impression by a person dosent always show how they really are. For example when youre on a date and you might be dressed in a way or talking with a different type of slang. But that dosent trully demonstrate that if the first time you guys went on a date. That on the second date you can give a better impression than you did the first date. You cant always judge someone by their appreance or on how they are. Another example is that if youre best friend thinks that you want to be with the prettiest girl in school you might want to step it up and change the way you are. You can change the way you are and the first time you meet her you were rude but youre best friend thinks she will like you if your sweet and friendly. Not everyone thinks the first impression is hard to change. However,I still believe that the first impression is the most important no matter what the situation is. I also still believe that the first impression is hard to change. Some people are different then others they dont all believe the same thing but in my case its hard to change how people see you the first time because,after that they are going to always look back at that and remember how you were. You always want people to think he best of you because,there going to be a situation that if they need someone they are going to look for you. To the people that think first impression arnt important they really are. You always want to show people the best of you no matter what. It dosent matter who youre with or where you are its always about showing the best about you so people can always look back see that you stand out in between so many people they will look at you. For example If your getting a job and you have a job interview at a certain time; You either might want to be there earlier then the time they gave you or on time. You have to impress the boss or the person interviewing you and blow their mind and why you would be a good person to be hired for that position.

410,2756,A1B06DEEA15C,"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, that failure plays an important role for some people in life, If they fail once they could get it right the second time and succeed. People will learn from their mistakes and it will take time for people to be successful in their life and accepted that they failed for the first time. Its very important for people to know that if they fail they can try again and can go back and check to see what was wrong or think to them self what they did wrong, They can learn from their mistakes and not give up when they fail the first time. People that have failed in life know that its not a bad thing when they fail. Its actually a good thing to fail in life and people that know what its like to fail would get inspired to work extra hard and take more time to look over everything. They would also stay on the positive side and have family, friends, and other people supporting them and cheering for them no matter what happens if they fail or dont fail. The British prime minister probably has fail in the past years when he was younger and was successful after he learned from his mistakes. Nobody is perfect in life thats why we fail in life to see what we did wrong and make sure that it doesnt happened in the future. Here is one example, If someone wants to open a coffee shop the person would need to get a loan from the bank so they can purchase a building and to start their own coffee shop business and come up with the names for the coffee shop, drinks, pastries, and food that will be on the menu. People that have wanted to start their own coffee shop business or other kinds of business, doesnt always work out for them for some reasons and are not very successful when doing the planing their ideas and would want to hire someone to help them come up with more ideas. The person might not be happy when he or she were unsuccessful for the first time to try and open their own business and take a few more months to come up with more ideas to be more successful for the second time. Overall, I think that failing is good thing and not a bad thing its just people dont have to give up after they fail the first time they need to give another second chances until they get it right. People should get inspire to keep working hard when they fail and not quit, because not everyone in the world is perfect in life.

411,2757,474D243CD03A,"Every students expect that they are going to have a great time in a summer break. Some students enjoy their long summer vacation because they do not have to worry about the school for a while. But some students want to reduce summer vacation and have longer breaks in winter, spring, and fall. There are some pros and cons on both sides, but I agree with long summer vacation and short breaks in winter and spring. Among the numerous reasons, my most important reasons are students cannot make a long time plan during the vacation; it is not effective to have a short shcool time and then have a break. One of my most important reason is that students cannot make a long time plan during the vacation. I believe that many students want to go travel or want to tour other countries with a long time plan, but if they have short vacation, they have to worry about the assignment and school while they are traveling. Sometimes, it is hard to see everything you want with a short time, so you regret that you did not have bunch of time. If one of their family lives in another country and it is hard to see each other, they have to make a plan to have a wonderful time with each other during the break. They, obviously, want to stay together for a long time because they do not know when they are going to meet each other again; It could be next year or 10 years later. They, however, cannot enjoy their time as much as they want if the student have to go back early. Because of these evidences, I agree with the long summer vacation. Another my most important reason is that it is not effective to have a short school time and then have a break. Every sports have a season and the players or coaches focus on their duty during the season; they do not have a break for like 3-4 weeks because of their body rhythm. I believe that it works for students, too. For example, people who want to be good at music instruments have to practice consistently; practicing 10 hours a day and doing nothing for a week does not help you at all. Even though the practicing time is shorter, using the instruments everyday reminds you and help you to get better. It is hard to come back to school after having a long break, but it is more effective when the students change their body rhythm for the school time than having a short break after a short school time. Because of these evidences, I agree with the long summer vacation. There are some advantages on the other opinion because not every single person has the same studying style. Some of the students study very hard during the short time period and then take a break, and it works for them. However, this type of studying has a risk that the students can forget what they have learned during the break because they tried to put much informations like math, science, english, and history in a short time. Even though the students who cram for the tests or assignments can get a good grade, they have to go over it after few moments later. Therefore, it is better to have a long summer vacation than a short summer vacation. As I mentioned, summer break is what students best time in a whole year. Almost every students makes their own plans on what they should do. Students, however, have a difficult before they have a summer vacation, so some of them want to reduce the summer break and make longer the other breaks. It is not a bad idea to move on, but they have to know that taking longer breaks in winter and fall would affect their whole summer plans. They also have to realize that they can do much more thing with longer break. That depends on how people use their own time, but if you have longer break it would give you wide opportunity.

Wouldnt it be great if we didnt have to fail? but thats how its some times. We have to accept it and keep trying. Life is fool of problems, but we just have hang in there and keep trying and get where we want. Another reason is that never loss of enthusiasm, thats the most important reason of all of this. if we dont have that exclusive word is like life does not make sense at all.

The Board of Teachers in a private school have said that, ""The more early a student starts their way to a career, the less struggle is for them to accomplish it"", because at their young age they have more time, less worries and not that much of responsibility, as a person gets older the more problems and responsibilities come to them, Although students also have many struggles in school, their house etc, is more less then an adult, That is why teachers think that is better for a student to commit a career at a young age because they are less worried. The percentage of students that commit a career at a young age is high, many of this students received a schoolarships others financial help, because of their behavior and their effort,The other half of this percentage of students have a well financial situation and there is no need for help or schoolarships, although there is a low percentage of students that prefer to work instead of going to college, because of their financial situation,However many students with low financial situation have succeed at their young age because of their effort to accomplish their dreams by working hard and knowing what they want to succeed in. Commiting a career at a young age could be difficult or it could be simple, there is more students that had said that is a great idea, because your mind at a young age is envolving in everything that surrounds the student, such as important information that would benefit him, as i said, the brain has more potencial to store as much information as it can, because the student is young and is focus on its goals and there is no problems or thoughts that could disstract the student. Other students had said that is a bad idea in a way of making the biggest decisition, which is choosing what career you want to accomplish, because at that age they do not actually know what they really want. Parents and the societies have a big influence when students are choosing which path to go, some parents wants their kids to follow their steps, so they encorage their kids to take courses that would help them as they go, parents would always want the best for their kids more when its about their future. Accomplishing a career at a young age brings many benefits, one of them is that the person not longer have to be thinking about it, takes a big weight off their shoulders, also the person would have more time for the family and especially the person would have many opportunities to find a job, because that person is young and lots of doors would be open for them.

415,2761,4ACFA2D3D0A1,"In my opinion I believe that it is better that we accomplish more it will make us more active. Im a firm believer that inactivity does not serve any purpose. This is the reason there is daylight and also nighttime; when its day time you get things done and when its nighttime you can rest or spend time relaxing. I also seen that the more you do the less you are to complain. Now let me explain to you some reasons why you should always accomplish a lot through out the day. My first thing I would like to start with is that there was a study at ""The University of Florida"" it showed that a person that does completes lots of tasks usually does better academically. Also you can get stressed if your not doing lots of work suffer health issues being active is important. The university tested 40 students 20 of them would show up to class on time get assignments done and come everyday. They would also be inspired to do better with there studies. It is also sometimes good to be inactive but that would mostly be during the night time when you have had a long days work you can sit down and just relax. Being a active person also makes you a more preferable person when you are working. People tell you that you are a hard worker when they see that you are doing your work on time. You are also preforming to the best of your availability. At my work I had this conflict with my co worker and instead of me arguing I just told her she was right and let it go. This lady would always be angry because her work she would be stressed out and yelling but that again comes in with being a lazy person. Being active can keep you out of trouble or addiction because you will not be so bored throughout your days. You will keep your head so busy that you will be so tired that you wont think about anything else just about taking rest and going home. Keeping bust is also a huge stress deliver because it makes your brain process things more quickly. Unlike with being inactive you just stay at home and do not do anything. Your brain will just be thinking all day about what it will do and you will get worried from not doing anything throughout the day. These are some of the reasons I believe it is good to be positive and not to be to worried. It is always good to consider why the night time and the day time was made the sunlight was to keep us awake and then the dark was made to make us fall asleep. Also keep in mind that the time you spend doing nothing can be put for good use and you can never take back the minutes or hours that you have spent doing nothing. These are some of the reasons it is always good to be a active human being so that you do not have any problems later in life.

Everyone has problems in their lives even if its a small or big issue, everyone wants easy fix problems but sometimes having them can give people chances to do their best. Being in a big issue where people dont know what do to, they will have to take chances and having to think to get out of the situation. For example if someone forgets their homework at school some choices are to print the homework at home or at a library. Not knowing what to do on a homework is never good but trying your best, even if its wrong. Duke Ellington is right because taking chances to do your best is great and you never know if something you made or done could be used in the future. Every job have situations for example builders may not have the materials that are needed, or teachers may not be able to read the handwriting. People who do parcor have to do their best to not fall off a building and if they are in a situation where they can jump to a different building or thing they might have to take chances and do their best to get to the other side.

419,2765,88FD7FAAFA90,"Some school require students to complete summer projects. This is a great idea, and it would be better if the students would be able to pick the topic. One of the reasons is students know what interest them more. Second they would put more effort and time on the project. finally studenst inprove there skills when writing something they enjoy. To start with, summer projects should be student designed. Students should be able to pick their topic do to they know what interest them and what doesnt. For example, Generic_Name a student at Generic_School was given a project about sea animals. Generic_Name doesnt know nothing about marine animals and has no interest on the project. Therefor, Generic_Name has no idea what to say and its not in his interest. Furthermore, Generic_Name will be in summer break it would be less stressful to talk bout a topic he likes instead of a boring one the teacher would give out. Also the students would put more effort and time to the project. Secondly, by the student knowing what he likes and his strength theyll aim for that A on the project. Students alfound do poorly on school project due to the topic they were given. For example, Generic_Name was given the topic to right about sports Generic_Name. Generic_Name has never done sports her self so there she has no interest on it. Generic_Name will do the project and get finished on time but, did not put time and effort to do her best. Undoubtedly, students do better on a topic they all feel good about. Finally the students will enjoy doing the project. Statistics show that when students write about something they like, they tend to improve in both reading and writing skills. For example, Generic_Name was able to right about a topic she likes, therefor, she enjoyed writing and improved her skills in reading and writing. Generic_Name enjoyed doing this project that she added more information about the topic. undauntedly, students summer project should be student designed. Despite this valid reasons there are does who think teacher should pick the topic. How ever they are wrong. Because students should be able to enjoy writing, and with the prompts the teacher gives out they just get stress out. Unquestibily, summer projects should be studenst desinged. To close up studenst will gain knolege and enjoy writing. They will aslo do better in the project do to is in there best interest. And finally a summer project should be fun not boring.

420,2766,B2AD2177A42C,"People can form their own character based on what they choose to make it. A person is given the responsibility of choosing whether to do the good or bad thing. For example, if a person hears that their friend is in a bad situation and then choosing to help them out, they are showing that they are capable of make their own character. Others may say that people do not get to choose their own character because it is beyond their control. However, people can determine their own character based on how they want it to be because they know what steps they have to take in order to achieve their goal, they know what is best for them, and they know what they want to become in the future. Knowing what steps to take will help the person make the right choice in defining their character. People tend to ask to other if the choices that they are making is the right one, but instead of asking others what they think the person has to be confidence in themselves that they are making the right choice. For instance, if a student wants a good future they have to work hard and study in order to accomplish it, and not choose to go the wrong way. On the other hand people may say that having a second opinion is a good thing, but that is wrong because it may cause them to doubt themselves. This is why people should first plan their transaction then take action on it. People have the free well to choose what they want to be and what is best for them. A person knows what their interest are, so they choose according to what they like to do the most. Furthermore, if a person finds a job that they really like and want to get it, they will work hard for it. Some may disagree with this because others may see that what they are choosing to do is not the best thing for them. This is why people need to think about their choices before doing anything. People can choose their own character and what they want to become in the future. People could choose to became; artists, actors, singers, or doctors because they have dreamed of becoming one of these seen they were a child. For instance, they would have to focus and work hard in order to achieve their future selves. However, others may say that it is impossible to become what you dreamed to be in the future because they will face may opsticals in their lives. On the other hand, if a person really wanted to become that person they will work intensively for it. A persons character can be constructed by how they choose make it because they know the course that they have to take in order to achieve their goal, they know what is best for themselves, and they know what they want to be in the future. For example, If a person wants something badly, they will work persistently for it. Another example is that, the person will prove to everyone that they are capable of achieving their dream, and that it is possible to get.

With guidance it can be helpful, it can also be misleading and people arent completely following their instincts. Self-reliance allows one to follow their own path and makes their own decisions. These types of situations is what most people struggle with, but this helps people benefit from themselves. We all value self-reliance to the fact that if someone makes their own decisions they have to solve the problem. In our minds we think about different things in a situation, the good and the bad. Although guidance makes you sound weak, but we want to be satisfied with our decisions. People who are self-reliance are capable of doing the same tasks they are in. In nature, most animals get to be self-reliance in order to stay alive, for example, as bear gets older, their parents have to let them go alone in the wild. We have voices in our minds that we talk to, and get really indecisive. Like when we shop, you choose between two or more pieces of clothing.

427,2773,C2F34D6A76D4,"""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Although the word failure is the lack of success, is the loss of the ability to work normally. As humans, we all know that sometimes instead of get better in life, we currently loss our capacities to start over and follow what we want for us because as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said ""do not loss the enthusiasm"". To being, humans fail every time in life, every episode in our life there is always a failure, it is always there for us like if we need it and maybe this is why we always wondered why failure have to happen during the most incredible episode in our life, we always think this is because we did something bad or we did not tried our best as much as we can for get that job, pass that test or even keep all our problems in line, but why failure became a big role into our daily life?. The reality of failure is not only fail, is to see what we did bad to get better, is to understand that we need to fail, understand that fail is good for us and help us to do not make the same mistakes that we did in the past because every time is a failure it is also an experience and a new lesson to success. For example, scientists tried many experiments to just get one result and they fail very often but at the end they discovered new things not just only what they were looking for. This shows that not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer and new things to discovered. Furthermore, stay positive for humans could became a big issue in our community. Every human try everyday to stay positive and see all the mistakes as much positives as we can but this became more stressful after a failure. What we all need to know is that feel stress, feel insecure of ourselves is good. We all are humans, our feelings make us more stronger than we actually are however, most people could feel depress after a failure and this is why we goes down, we loss our hope and most people stop to keep working in their goals and just get tired and feel depress. For example, there is a book that the students of Generic_School were reading last year called ""The life of an Indian"". This book is about a poor Indian boy that lives in a reservation, he has no hopes after one day his teacher introduced the Indian to a different world out of the reservation to find hope and believe in himself, follow his dreams instead to keep poor in the reservation. He fail a thousand times, but instead to get back, he goes thought his issues. This shows that stay positive after our failures even for a poor little boy is not always too hard. Clearly not everyone could do it that way, but we always want our happiness, and to get happiness, failure could became our big right hand. In conclusion, join from our mistakes is the best way to be successful, to be better in life, to keep in mind that every failure is a new experience and a new lesson. Not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer. I am completely agree with Winston Churchill, feel enthusiasm for what go next in our life is more excited than we all think and as humans, if we start to believe in ourselves and stay positive and start to dream and also understand that failure is part of our daily, we will become more successful with the knowledge to how life really works and that life is not too hard as we all been thinking.

Having a bad attitude can effect other peoples mood it can make them happy or sad. Having a good attitude makes more people happier and feel calm. Attitude effects almost all of the day and other peoples day including your family and pets. If your mad all day its because someone was mad to you or just got effected by it from someone eles. Its just better to have a good attitude all day than being mad all day and causing other people to be mad insted of being happy. Being happy in the worst times in your life is a good thing and can change your fellings somehow. I would rather have a good day in a bad day than have a bad day. If half of the world had a good attitude next thing you now the whole world has a good attitude. But people dont like doing that they rather be mean to other people and thats why the whole world is violent and wars start and people die Because people dont have good attitudes. Good attitude effects a lot of people like in music and in movies sometimes its good and sometimes its bad. People that are famous and have bad attitudes are really common they get mad at their fans but the fans is the only reason why their famous and rich. Rich people are usually the sad ones and the poor are usually the happier ones because they have better attitudes. Good attitudes effect a lot and so do bad ones thats why thiers all types of people in the world. Good ones and bad ones the ones with good attitude and the ones with bad attitude. Good attitudes effect friends and family and thats why people should always have good attitudes. One time I was testing and I had a good attitude but when I saw my score I had a bad attitude for the rest of the day. And the same things happens when my parents are mad at each other it gives me a bad attitude for the rest of the day in school and in soccer. But when someone is nice to me or gives me a complement I feel better about myself and it chages my attitude. Sometimes having a good attitude in the worst times is bad like having a good attitude in a funaral or at a sad movie. But sometimes its best to be happy and have a good attitude to spread good energy to other people and family. Its sometimes good to have a bad attitude so people can know your sad and be happier near you to cheer you up. Being nice and having a good attitudes can really change someones day so try it and complement people so they will do the same thing back. I usually have a good attitude even when I have a really bad headache or am sick because having a bad attitude is not fun. and it makes other people have bad days or feel bad so thats why I always have a Good attitude. To other people and my family so they will all have a good attitude and thats why having a bad attitude is bad because it causes bad thing and we dont need that we need to be nice and help other people. Thats why people are so mean and dont care. And thats why problems start and people get mad and thats why you should have a good attitude everyday to make other people happier.

We use our phones for lots of thing like looking at the news, or to see what time is it.

Most of it is caused by bullying. Years ago the government allowed students to attend online courses and a good amount of students left high school and stayed to take online courses. Students should attend online courses because bullying would decrease nand it would be easier to find your way through the website instead of walking from class to class. Bullying would have a major decrease because students would be at home instead of school. Everyday students get harassed by other students and then up to the point where it drives them to commit suicide. Students would be at their house where its safe and less distracting. Also, some students are too shy to be around other people so they get bullied for it. Every parent doesnt want to see their kid get bullied. There so much negativity being spread around and it not only affects the victims life it also affects their families. It would be easier to find your way through online courses instead of walking class to class.

437,2783,079FDB42E429,"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. Schools offer this so that students who are troubled or dont like coming to school can still have a right to to learn and it also helps students who are very sickly to have access to all their classes and homework that they missed when their not at school. Some students can not focus in class because they are easily distracted by other students and by these distractions they end up getting bad grades and it causes them to lose hope in school and even what they want to become in life. they could also have something happening outside of school that could affect them to not want to be in school anymore and they can also get bullied by other students which would make them stop coming to school and some kids are just better off staying a home and doing classes at home. These online and distance learning classes can help students get back on track with school and catch up with their work that they missed. The students who want to be home schooled can wake up at anytime that they choose and do the work that is planned for them and the ones that dont like coming to school or the ones that get bullied can stay at home and get their work done without missing class and getting bad grades because of them not being their to do classwork or take test and quizzes. The students who are taking these classes can benefit from these a lot. These programs can help students be able to their work on their own time and a have teacher who can teach them but online like at school and this can help students become independent in being able to do their work and help them stay away from trouble that they could be having at school and give them confidence to be able to do their work. I think this can benefit students because they are in the comfort of their homes and its like a regular class but it just online and you could get all your work done and by that you earn good grades. If students who dont like coming to school,sickly and get bullied,always miss class and get bad grades because their are not their to take tests or quizzes then these online and distance class can benefit them to do work at the comfort of their home.

438,2784,DBDE16551908,"I think the best way is to work as a group. You might ask why. is the best way students get to learn, For example; Im the type of student that like to hear about peoples opinion. By listining to other people opinin give the other student a idea on how the project or the assigment should be done. When student get the chance to express they idea they feel confident no fear to express themselve. Many students like to work bby themselve, therefore no other student interrupt the by asking to many question. Most of them already have a topic to talk about they already have a plan. For Example student that work alone they mostly working at their own pace, working alone give then the chance of finishing on time. Working as a group give the student the chance of dividing the work in different sections, For example; this student would do this part, the pther student would design the project, the other student would do the research. Dividing the project in different part let the student look or choose the part the thing is easy to do ot they know how to do it already. Student get to meet new people, by doing a project like a group student somtime dont get to choose who they work with, The profesor might give the students a group of people they never meet before. working as a group with new people let you find a new ways to work or write. For example you meet this new student who make a T chart and write the good about this topic and the negative side about the topic next to it. After looking at it he decide what side he should talk about. You get things done a lot faster by doing in groups as I said before working with a group let the work get done a lot faster, its give the people the chance of focusing and the part they have to get done. If you finish your part of the project or assigment, you can volunteer to help other team mate. For example someone that works by themselve might need more time, because shes working by her self and you get the chance to volunteer to help her out on something, she might found difficult to do. In my conclusion, working like a group it teach the students to listen to other peoples thoughts and, its the best way students work as one. But other peolpe would say that working alone is the best choice, because it teach the student how to make decision on their own and how they should write their own paper with anybody helping them out.

441,2787,8C645419E1B4,Others would not appreciate kindness. First acts of kindness has an impact on others because others may not be used to being kind to everyone around our environment. Next showing kindness to other people is not something everybody does on a daily bases however that does not mean we hate each other we just dont show what kindness really looks like. Finally its not always good to be kind to others because other people like to be treated good or bad. Kind isnt always the best choice. First being kind isnt always the best choice in different situations. For example picking if a student should get bullied or choosing a friend for you to help on the test like who would a help. Next kindness can also lead you to big trouble. For example u standing up for a student who gets hurt and bullied by the bully if your school has no cameras around its easy for the bully to lie about the situation that happened with the kid who got bullied if there are no cameras in your local school. Finally about the bullying part the person who is getting bullied by the bully and the person who is standing up for the kid who gets bullied they can even get in trouble for interfering. Dont be kind to those who arent good people First students and others who are being mean to you they are probably not a good person therefore dont talk to them and shouldnt be kind to them. Also a reason to not be kind to those who arent good people is because they have the discipline to teach themselves to treat others right. Finally if you are getting annoyed by the person who is being mean to you than talk to a teacher about it and they can talk to the student about being kind to others.,6,8,7,8,8,8,1867,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 6"

Technology today is now making it easier for us humans to do things and also showing us what the furture could look like in a couple of years. Why would this be a negative thing ? if people are just trying to make are lives easier. For an example lets say you need to get some where but fast and you dont have a ride there is now a app where you send your location and give the address to place you need to go and somebody will take you. Technology is such a great thing and its becoming greater each and everyday. There are many different types of apps that you can download on your phone today for anything. lets say that your at home and your really hungry but you dont want to leave the house you can download an app called grubhub that will make sure you dont miss a meal. what is grubhub its an app that delivers food from anywhere. All you do is tell the person what you want to eat the location of the place to pick up the food and your address so they know where to drop it off. And its that easy this thing that we call a phone can make all this happen with a little bit of typing. these apps are for free too but it may cost for the food but not everything is free in life. Computers are also a big part of technology. Computers and laptops are used everyday could be for school for work for anything. Computers help out a lot in school for anyone who needs to do research and any type of information he or she did not know about.

Most people wanted to get better after they have had worked on themselves to be successful already, but in the other hand, people did not have opportunity to go to school. or may be they just did not feel confident enough that they could be better. In my opinion, I think that people should try their best to be something that will benefit other people so that you gain support and just keep expanding. The first reason why I agree on Emeersons statement is because. The more you have experience in something, the more chances you have on getting better at it. I think that getting better at something is really important in life in order to live a good lifestyle. But some people are not able to make changes to their selves. They maybe dealing with family issues or personal issues that is keeping them to take advantage of changing. Another reason why I agree on Emeersons statement is because. Most people have skills that they learned when they were young which is considered knowledge. That specific skill or knowledge might help you advance something. But at the same time a lot of people have disappointments on their selves and surroundings, which can cause the thinking of not changing to the better. The final reason of why I agree on Emeersons statement is because. Most people when they are confident and comfortable, then they would release the skills and persuade the change that is going to make them a better person, and that could change their life forever. it is convenience and worth making the change no matter what the situation be so do not take advantages the wrong way After all, there has been a lot of different opinions and ideas all around the world, but you as an individual should know what is best for you. we have talked about why and why not people should move up to the next step which is changing. changing can harm or improve you if you do it the right way, by taking chances since young then, most of us would have a lot more better strategies and know what is right from wrong by the time we grow.

Actually it should be allowed in classrooms,for research purpose and projects during class. by the used of cell phones. We can learn more about any topic, an example of this can be,if the teacher is explaining something and i dont understand instead of asking him. I can go to internet and find out. all the things that i need to learn and with examples. I agree with the assertion of using cell phones in classrooms. Those who believe, that cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms,have their reasons,for example they believe that cell phones are distracted, in a way that students cant control it. They also think that cell phones are addictive. However,that is not true because we all can control our self, and i think that if we use our cell phones in a corresponding way, we will not only learn more, we will improve our skills and in the future become professional in anything. I believe that we should used cell phones for research purpose,for example i remember when i was in English class i got sick, and i had to go to the doctor when i came back, to school the teacher was giving directions for our next assignment,but in that moment i felt like i was out a lot of days,but no it was only 2 days out of class,so i said to him I feel like i had miss a lot of thing just let me know what i need to do, and i will try to do everything that i need,so he said we went over more vocabulary, but right now i am explaining something, if you want to do it you have to stay after school i will be happy to help you. I said no you dont have to explaining me nothing, just give me the vocabulary i will look it up in internet,and i will write down the meaning of each word i will be quiet,so you can keep doing what you doing. He said fine. If cell phones are not allowed in classrooms, I could not do my vocabulary, and not only that i improved my skills by researching for good information which is not easy. I think that this is a good example why we should used cell phones in classrooms, so we can use them in a correct way thinking about our grades. I also think that we should used cell phones for projects. This is my friend called Generic_Name he is 17 years old we are friends from middle school. In this time we were in government class, once again the teacher gave us a group activity in this case we had to came up with a new country, otherwise invent country,so we had to give it name,where it will be located, and the rulers for its country. After that,all the students got their own computers,but there were not enough for everyone,so we had no computers next,we asked the teacher can we used our cell phones,for the project she asked if there were no more computers and we said no not more,so with no choice the teacher said yes,used your cell phones,but only for the project,without wasting time we got our phones out,and we started working on our new project we worked in our cell phones as we had computers after the hard work we stopped,because the bell ring. This is another proof why cell phones are important they are really helpful in many different s ways we used all cell phones,for the whole project and thanks to that we turned in our project on time. In conclusion,we should all used cell phones in classrooms for research purpose and projects. having in mind that a lot of people will not agree,but cell phones are helpful. They are important. technology is here for us,so we can take an advantage, and use it like it is for our own purpose. cell phones will provide a better understanding to all the students in all schools We should reflect about it, and came up with our own position.

447,2793,12920189F7BB,"Some societies may think that students are expected to identify a career by the time they reach high school. High school students shouldnt rush their selves to think about the career they want to accomplish. Most importantly they should stay focused on whats important which is education. Students have more than enough time to think about their careers, but not at this moment. Theyre too young to understand the reality that theyre going to face, and the struggle that theyre not expecting to happen. Which is why its really important for them to stay focused on their education, than to suffer later in their lives. To be honest, nothings wrong with thinking about your career, but its not always healthy to think or stress about it all the time. Because it could cause an affection on your mind which isnt good. For students who first enter high school, should think more importantly about their grades and how well theyre doing in school. At a young age students are fed in with so many ideas and careers that they want to accomplish in life. Their minds are too young to understand, so its very important for mentors to help them realize that its better to accomplish from education, than to suffer in the real world. For example, high school students who work after school, never find the time to come home and focus on completing their school activities. Because of their job thats holding them back. As a student, its commonly stressing to go through these types of stuff. In fact, no high school student should have to go through these type of things. They have a whole life ahead of them and have the time to think about their goals. So, its very important for students to focus on whats important, and not worry so much about what they want to achieve or accomplish in their career. The goal to everything is education, maybe some day when students accomplish their ways in education, theyll probably achieve the career that theyve been looking for.

The Japanese market, the one place I want to go at most in my mind. Everytime, you already can hear the laughing sounds even youre not step in. With this happy atmosphere, and walk slowly to find out the things you want to buy. How warm is it. The nicest scene is not just that, but also when the night is coming. During some special holidays, a bunch of people will came here and participate some small activities which only have at night. At this time, the laughing sounds is even louder than morning.

449,2795,3F1ED9A56002,"The one thing students shouldnt have are phones. Why? It is because students in different country always use their phones for my reason The first reason why students shouldnt have a phone because of social media. What is social media that you might be asking? Well social media is where people can comment on pictures or video. The one that i should add to that is that students everyday will always go on their phone and posted a picture or a video of them self or with someone. The second reason why students shouldnt phones because they might have download something that could get them hacked or giving information to someone that they dont know on the internet. The third reason why students should have phones because sometimes people can get bullied on the internet which the term is called cyberbullying. What is cyberbullying that you might be asking? Cyberbully is another form of bullying, but it is on the internet. The third reason why students shouldnt have a phone because some students will sometimes look on their phone without looking at where they are going. Some students got them killed because of that reason. So I suggest to not use your phone while you are walking across the street. The fifth reason why students shouldnt have a phone because of you posting a picture of you in a different country. Well that is risk because you could get robbed. How do you even get robbed first of all that you might be asking? Well you post a picture of you in a different country and that is giving the robs more of a chance to rob your house. The sixth reason why students shouldnt have a phone because they might prank call some local fast food restaurant. If you prank call the police, you will get yourself in trouble for that reason which many people in different country prank call the police for funny reason and also bad reason. The seventh reason why students shouldnt have a phone because it could explode because you are using all the time. If you are using it none stop, then it will explode on you so I suggest that you should use it for 2 hours or so. The last reason why students shouldnt have a phone because of how addicting it is to everyone. That is the reason why students shouldnt have a phone",5,7,6,7,6,7,816,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 5"
450,2796,4665A1D77D6C,"In this passage i will tell you my point of view of this, I believe that it dosent matter how much experience someone has over the other person, it only increases there chances of getting picked, and only by a small margin. my reason is that people shouldnt pick a person by what or how much experience they have, but pick the people that are best for the job such as being a hard worker, fast learner, or by being determined to work. you might not have the experience but they can still pick you for the job, all you have to do is to prove to them that you can do learn it and will be able to do after it. I think getting a new job is like learning a new unit in a class all you need is a person to show you how they do it and improve on that and, you will have setbacks or things that you wont understand. but you will still have the teacher or the person that is helping you, that can tell you if your doing something wrong or to answer your questions. once you had enough practice with it, you can help other people that have the same problems as you or the same questions. by getting the job youve learned how to do those things and how to teach other people how to do it too. you dont need experience you need people with experience to teach you so you can teach other people. In my experience to have a good worker they dont need to have experience, they only need people to teach them while there working seeing what they are doing wrong and improving on that. while i was working in a construction job, i was making mistakes all over the place, i wasnt doing well with tools or machines, sometimes i would cut the materials too small or too large, so most of the time i would hand it over to one of my coworkers and with the tools, most of the time would get them mixed up, for example one coworker will ask for a tool and my mind would just be blank then they would just get it themselves, so after i had to practice with the tools and by the end of the time i was working there i never got one thing wrong, this proves that all you need is practice during the job or work, it dosent matter if you have never done it before all you need to practice. Although i do acknowledge the people with experience have more of a chance to get the job there going for but all im saying is that you shouldnt doubt yourself when someone has experience and you dont, just keep your eyes open and your head strong and see if you got the job, and if you didnt, try another time, it dosent matter if you fail to get the job once or multiple times, it dosent matter if someone has more experience then you, if you prove to them that you can work harder then them, and learn more then them they will pick you for the job. all you need to do is go to the interview and show what you can do and what sort of person you are. In this passage i have show that you dont need to have the experience to get the job or being a good worker, you just need to be determined to do the work and they will recognize that, and they will respect you more. but only if you do good work you cant expect good things to happen because of bad results, but if you prove to them that you will be able to learn how to do it then you will get the job. i have also shown my own experience with it of being a worker that had no experience to being the one that never messed up at the end.

452,2798,DC467256CD82,"Technology, 21st centuries finest product. nearly everyone loves technology, is it really that beautiful? When i was a kid people used to say ""technology will end our social life."" I didnt believe that then, but now i see what they were trying to say. Primarily technologys goal is to make certain tasks easier, not to make us anti-social or make us obese. In my opinion technology has a great potential, and we are not using it to the full potential, we are supposed to use it to make simple task easier, but people are spoiling this potential by instead of making our own food we now order it from a restaurant which is ten times unhealthier. Another thing that is a huge problem is people building their life around technology, if they lose that technology they think theyll die. Everyone uses social apps on their phone, and thats a huge issue because that is one of the main reasons of people choosing social media over having conversations face to face. Secondly, technology has its pros as it has its cons. One of the main advantages of technology is minimizing the waste of time in simple daily life tasks. For example, before technology people used to communicate with mails which took a long time to arrive at the designated place, however currently you can shorten that whole process to only a minute or two. Also with technology we can make waste free houses, cars, planes, and many other things by making them operate with electricity rather than fossil fuels which harms our planet. We can harvest electrical energy by solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric turbines. Another great thing about harvesting electrical energy is that they are infinite unless a disaster happens and suddenly all our water vaporizes or the sun gets blocked or the wind stops blowing. Until disasters like those happens we are good to go with waste free energy. Third of all I think that technology is a great invention for the human kind. Although it has multiple harmful effects for people, the way to cure those are as easy. If we stop building our life around social media or technology, and keep technology as just a secondary communication device. Technology has come a far way from where it started. Once it was used just to power a light bulb, now its used to power our cars, houses, phones, cities, everything you see that is human built has some sort of technology in it. Finally all these great inventions, all of these dazzling things took our attention and isolated us from the others. I think that technology is a brilliant invention but also it is a very harmful one for our social life. Human is a social creature by its nature, if something blocks the socializing part of being human it will end badly. If someone tries to change a creatures nature it will try to avoid it, for thousands of years it has evolved to its current state, and now we are trying to change it... All Im trying to point out is technology is a beneficial element of our life but social-life is not one of them.

453,2799,D45494CE3D2E,"Human survival depends on technology, we can not live without it. Technology is used in our everyday lives, from the very moment we open our eyes to the end of the day when we go into our sleep. Technology has really advanced a whole lot in comparison from the first telephone made up, to todays modern devices. Technology may have a negative impact to it, since technology is everywhere it is almost impossible to keep out of reach. Young children start to us it to early in life, they get addicted and they cry if it is taken from them. Technology may have that negative affect but it has many positive affects that come from it as well. The beginning of technology all starts back when the first telephone was created by Alexander Graham Bell. The telephone he had created is much different from the ones you see today in everyday use by millions of people. His creation of the telephone was like a brick, very big and heavy. That device was more of a at home used only kind of device, not something you could easily just carry around with you. his invention probably was not the most popular right away since everyone was so use to living with out one it was not much of a necessity. As time progressed other inventors took Graham bells invention and invested further into it, adding and taking away things it had. For one the size and weight of it was changed by a lot through out time as well as the capability of what you could do on it. At first it was used only to transfer calls to communicate with somebody verbally without having to be face to face or even at close distance with them. Many individuals wanted to be the inventor of a phone and there are more than one, therefore because of this there are different companies, not just one that produces electronic devices. Around the early 2000s Apple, which is one of the biggest electronic device companies had released the first Iphone. Everyone and everywhere all around the world people were purchasing Apples new product. Throughout the years Apple has made so many products for people to purchase from cell phones,earphone, tablets, computers, watches, portable chargers, to just about anything for people to buy that they may use in there everyday lives. Though all these advancements in technology may have caused some negative impacts in life such as that children from a young age get addicted from them it has also helped them. Parents have a big impacts in this whether they decide to hand their children a electronic or not, most parents that do let them opporate a device usually have limitations in what they can do or watch and for how long. Letting young children use this technology isnt all bad, there are television shows that help them learn their shapes, colors, objects, movements and simply learn how to communicate with others before entering school, nothing wrong with being a little ahead of others. ABC mouse is one of many great resources online that help children with their education and it is also done in a fun way for them to learn and enjoy their studying. Technology is used by everyone all around the world and even out in space! Everything around us is being technologically used by us, inside of our own homes and outside. Security cameras, the thermostat that keeps us warm in the comfort of our homes and AC that helps us cool down on hot sunny days, the foods and drinks we store away in our fridges and freezers, WiFi box, T.V(s), door bells, all of that technology and thats just in our homes. Outside everyday technology would be like he vehicle we use to get to our jobs, the traffic signals, GPS to help guide use to get to our desired destination. You have a paper due or something you really need information on whether it is school related or not and the library is closed or you just can not get in reach of one you can simply do your research from any location you may be in with a click and swipe on a screen like your cell phone or computer. Machines are technology used like those in hospitals that are seriously used for human survival when someone is terribly injured or a new baby is born. Technology is still progressing and it will only become more advanced through out time, everyday inventors and scientist use it to make new ways to cure up diseases, find out where they come from and how they can be prevented. The creation of technology on our world has been very helpful to us all in every way possible, without it there are many possibilities of certain deaths and accidents that could have occurred if it did not exist. The amount of advancement that it had gotten to will only help it get greater so we can be prepared for future tragedies that we would not want this world to face. Technology has been an extremely positive thing that has happened in this world for millions possibly even billions of people who use it.

454,2800,0C28481DFBB8,"In my opinion, I know why Thomas Jefferson decide to wrote this for his people. He want to see if we are responsible with our own work and left to lose the time just little things, he just want that his people can make their dreams. When he wrote this people was scare because their people was slave before Abraham Lincol become president of the United State. This show three reason why he wrote this. First, Thomas Jefferson spend his time with us because he want to see how his people really following his wrote. Many people dont think about what they can do in their life, if we still spend time with other people we dont accomplish our own dreams, sometimes people are shy,and scare with their dreams because other people can bother them because they can accomplish their dreams or may be they dont believe in them. Some people cant acommplish their dreams because they think that is lot stuff but the reason is that they never try, if they can accommplish their dreams. Second, if we look and read carefully we can find more about this wrote. We really cant thinking about because we dont have commitment to make our own dreams better. Some people are in school but they dont see the opportunity that we have for make a lot stuff in the future. We just go at school because our mothers dispatch us at the school. If we used about Thomas Jefferson wrote we can learn how we have work hard for make our life much better. We just have to think just in the our future and study more for have a good grade and accomplish the dreams we wish. Third, in this time we have much time in our own life for do a lot stuff because we are freedom. But we just think to go out with friend and have fun, nobody care their dreams in this time. They spends their time in party and doing lots stuff with our friends. If we still doing the same things with our friends we never get something better in our own life. We need to have more commitment about what we really want in our future. In conclusion, we can be better than other people because we are young and we can do more stuff. We can teach them thst we can do all this stuff, if we can think better. We have a good concentration in all what we do. Dont matter what we can accomplish our own dreams because we are not alone we have our familes for support us with really we want to do in the future.

One reason the school board shouldnt add one and a half more hours is because there will be no time for after school activities. For example if Generic_Name has soccer practice anymore. Another example is if Generic_Name hosts computer club she cant host it because there is no time for hosting her club. Another example is if they and one hour and a half then there would be no time to have fun at school. The second reason the school board should not add one hour and a half is because your going to have to give the teachers more money for the extra hours. An example is that if there child is sick and they need to pick them up but they cant because they are teaching. Another example is if Generic_Name is the boss of the school board and the extra one hour and a half she is going to have to do extra work so she make sure that everyone gets there pay check. Another example is teachers are going to have to make sure they have enough work for the extra time and plus they have to grade all of the work the students do. The last example is that the bell schedule will be different and the people who work are going to do a lot of work to schedule lunch and everything. Another reason i disagree with my school adding one hour and a half more time is that the teachers are going to have to face a lot of tied and sleeping students. Another example is if half of the students are sleeping and tiered there is no point of teaching them because they are likely not going to do work or forget everything they learned that day. Another example is that the teachers will be angry from all the students with their heads down because they are tiered. Another example is that students and teachers have family and places to be.

Also technology can help doctors, to determinate what is wrong with the patient. It helps doctors when they make an peration.

After school students can do their homework instead going to other places like in the pass. Technology helps people with security, people use cameras to keep secure places.

Technology also helps with the traffic security, like lights in the road to see where are you going, see if the car infront of you stops, and cars have cameras to see when you are going back.

458,2804,6C86103B510D,"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Influencing others with your own behavior is the best example you can give. The example of showing someone your actions than your words is the best way to be an influence. The actions as words are powerful over anothers person life but I think that the actions are the best way to show someone who you really are. I agree with Albert Schweitzer because it is the best way to influence others by showing and doing your own behavior. People follow others because they like the other persons personality does not matter is it good or bad. We always have been influenced in our lives by our family,society, school, and now more than anything the social media. Some people might no agree with Albert Schweitzer because they might say people are what they want to be not necessary being influence for someone. Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on. However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow. I also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone elses life there is nothing better than our own behavior. We all have our own personality,likes and dislikes and sometimes those ""likes and dislikes"" can be an influence for someone else. In my opinion peoples actions are really important and have a powerful influence over others. Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.""

460,2806,E81B50098AAC,"In my opinion students should come to school. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students,which allows the students to be irresponsibles and not to show their work to the teacher. As we can see taking classes online is not a good option to us, for instance if we dont make the time to attend the classes online, or by the time we are taking the online classes we received a text for friend we stop doing what we are doing and got distracted by the electronic devices and, others words if we come to school received classes we are going to be able to get the knowledge that we need to be great in our academic life. I consider myself that taking online classes is not a good option for students. Some students that take online classes are procrastinators,they dont care about their homework, or they wait until the last minute to do it. The truth is, if we dont take our online classes seriously how we are going to learn. For example, My friend Generic_Name is taking online classes and she said that taking online classes allow her to be irresponsible by not doing her homework. Some students dont make the time to take the online classes and we just forget to take it. I wonder how we are going to learn if we dont make the time to do it. Sometimes we got distracted for something that have nothing to with the class that we are taking. However, if we have a job and we got home late, and in our mind is to get home and take the online classes, but when we get home we are so tired and we just want to go to bed, and forget about what we have to do. The last and more important reason what we should take classes in school is, if we attend to school,we can ask questions to the teacher and he can provides us with a powerful answers and specific examples, if we attend to school that will helps us to get a responsibility to be every day at school and not to miss any important class, and also that would gives the knowledge that we would need to be great in life. In final consideration I think students should come to school and take our classes, that way we would learn more better than taking it in online, and also that we will makes us more responsible. As we take the classes in school we will get the knowledge that we would need to success in our academic life in general we would be great in our professional life.

The first reason, is when I went to the the Community Park for the first time. I could see this big blue, and yellow playground. Also I could see people running up and down at the Community Park having so much of fun. There was also other people playing tag with other people at the park. Lastly, the Community Park had so many fun equipment to play. Like the swing, slides, wall climbers and the monkey bars. There were a lot of people there so we had to wait for our turn to use every equipment they had at the Community Park. Second reason, is when I went to the State Park for the first time too. I could remember walking under the trees with a nice wind blow to my face in a nice shadow made by the trees. Also I kept walking and I saw a lot of animals that were not attacking people. Animals that I saw were Frogs, Turtle, Fish, Lobsters, Birds, Snakes, Deer, and Ducks all over the park. Lastly, I saw their was a big river where people were fishing. Then Other people were swimming in the river water because it was a very hot day outside at the park. Last reason, is when I went to the National Park for the first time also. The park has a lot of fun things that we can go look at and visit animals at the park. The animals they can go and visit are Monkeys, Snakes, Giraffes, Turtles, Tigers, Pandas, Birds, Frogs, Crocodiles, Gorillas, Sea Lions, Donkeys, Horses, Lions, Lizards, Iguana, and Elephants. Lastly, the National Park has food stands were we can go and buy food if we get hungry at anytime. We can take brakes if we get tired of walking in the National Park and sit down. In conclusion, enjoying the outdoors is very fun because we can go and visit a lot of different Parks. I will never forget the first time I went to the Community Park, State Park, and the National Park because its a very fun way to enjoy the outdoors day.

And even though you dont show a lot of kindness even a little bit change on the other person because of the kindness that you were showing. If you think showing kindness is a waste dont think that because showing some kindness can show the other person that you care about them.

My second reason is when you eat health on school days your body will feel better and relax and also when you eat healthier foods your body can help you in the future as you grow older health foods in school would be a great way for students not to be sick and they need protein to grow. My thrid reason is if you take away our favorite food most students wont eat the healtheir food, remember when their was no Fried Chicken friday at lunch and thats like everyones favorite food the school was so upset they didnt eat lunch for the day over chicken. So in conclusion I think that we should balance them out like their should days were we eat health foods and days we can eat favortite foods. When the food is Balance students will be able be more happy if they just have both their favorrite foods and something Health to eat, so in my opinon i really hope you make students have both their favorrite foods and healtheir foods so that all students would be happy and so as their body.

Also the other person doesnt have any saying in your life, if you dont want them to. And you are the only person who can change the outcome of your life. even so your the main person in your life, its okay to hear others out even though they are wrong sometimes or if they are sometimes right. The first reason is that its okay if you dont want the other persons help. But you should hear them out so you can get something out of thing. For example my friend Generic_Name, she love to write stories and love to sing, and dance, but she too embarrassed to do what she love. So one day I gave her some ideas, but she didnt want any, because she dont want to do them, but next day, she gave some of my ideas a try and she like it but still dont want to do it anymore. But long as she listened that good enough for me. The second reason is people dont have any saying in your life, yes its true, but theres people willing to help you through your life. But it only depend on you, if you want their help or not. For a example my sister Generic_Name doesnt want help from me nor our parents. But its okay, because she know that we want to help her, because we care about her,so we will not stop trying to help her. But there is times she let us help her out with her life, and thats good. Longs she lets us in her life, thats good enough for us. Last reason is you still are the main person in your life, so no matter what you do your life, just remember it your life is your alone, and you are the only one who can change the outcome of your future. even If you want the help of others or not. For example Im 18 years ago, and im still having problems in my life, but there are people that are willing to help me, but im scared at no matter what im still feeling down with stuff.

Think about the good choices and how it will bring joy into your life. First, my cousin was going through a bad path last year when he was a freshman in high school. He would always come home late at night. He always had his mother worried about him. Next, there was this one night where she was so worried, she had to call the police because she thought something bad happened to him. When my mom told me about the situation, I never looked up to it, never imagined myself doing that. In addition, he would barely answer his mothers phone calls. She was devastated seeing her son go through a bad path. One day she was done with the things he did, so she decided to take him to Generic_City with my 37 year old cousin. He spent about 2 weeks in Generic_City so that he would think about his bad choices. When he came back, his mother decided to move to another house and another school for him. Finally, things are so much better now. His grades are much better now, he doesnt go out to late at night anymore, and his mom is peacefully working. My cousin is doing good choices now. First, he is not in bad paths anymore thanks to his mother. Recently, he has been working out and eating healthy. Every Saturdays and Sundays morning, he goes to the gym with this older sister that is 21 years old. Next, he gets home he eats a bowl of sugar free oatmeal with sliced strawberries and blueberries. I know for sure that he wants to be a new and better person. Last year when he was a freshman, he would skip a lot of school days. His mother would get phone calls of him absent. But, he is putting a lot of effort into school. Over the summer, my dad decided to take him to work with him. My cousin helped him out with construction tools. They both worked for about 7 hours that day. A few days later, my dad had to meet up with his boss and other co-workers to earn the money. Lastly, my dad, siblings and I drove to his house to not only drop off the 80 dollars he earned, but also see how him and his family were doing. I never experienced this, and I know that I never will. Seeing the suffer in his mom was terrifying. I would never want my mother to suffer the way his mother did. Think about the good choices and how it will bring joy into your life. I would be very lost to see myself into his bad choices.

471,2817,F6EAE029B20B,"Today world, everything start to moving forward. People start to invent the new ideas and those ideas make life more easily. In medical world, people make a new kind of medicine to cure the disease, compare to the old world a lot of people had die. In technology world, people put those ideas into the physical objects that it is so important for today life. From all we see everything is start from the ideas and who invent the idea? This is the kind of the question that no one ever ask. It is us the people that invent the idea. People can make a change to the world if they start to think or we can call the attitude. The attitude of the people have a big impact to the surrounding. But not all the attitude have a good impact to the world it also have a bad impact. This is led to one of the controversial question from the science; that said do you agree or disagree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. From my perception I agree that the positive attitude is the key to success in life because it make a people have a good communication in the community between people and people, make us being more productive on everything we do, developed our self and also things surround us quickly. Everyday people need to make a connection to one another. And exchange the information from that connection. But the important thing is the way we thinking. Like in the school, there are a lot of student from different place and family. But some student is isolate and other is sociable. Most people think that the isolate student mostly are bad and the sociable student mostly are good. The reason that the student being isolated because there is something in the school that student can not accept so they become isolated. It kind like when you move from place to place you try to fit yourself in. It take time for them to being sociable like other student. This is not the reason for us to think that the isolate student have a negative attitude. And also not all the sociable student have a positive attitude. We can learn from the past that thing happen in high school led the student to commit suicide. The student that have a negative attitude like to bullying other student and left them no choice. For the student that commit suicide also have a negative attitude because they take the outside source seriously then them self. This is the small example that we can compare for what the meaning of the word attitude is. People like to say that most millionaire are a bad person. We can not believe in this conventional wisdom. People sometime said the bad thing to other to make them self look good. But from what I see most millionaire have a good attitude because it led them to being more productive. Productive person is the person that you should be friend with. They always share the good things in their mind to you. Not just in the business world that have a productive person. Also in the community that we live in everyday. People we meet everyday that like to talk about the good things that happening to them. They share the idea how to get there and how to do it. It not means that they try to show off to you. Dont thing them wrong. We can see when the people get their new job, they like to share the idea . You just need to open your heart and listen to them. It might one day you can use this idea to do other things too. Also in the political world, a lot of Prime minister, President, try to keep them self productive by doing a charity to the poor people. This is why the world become smaller and smaller. There are a lot of country in the world with a different culture, tradition and religion. And a lot of people know at least one language that is not their mother tough language. But also a lot of people that only know how to speak their mother tough language. When we were young, we spending time mostly in school and they teaching us the art, history, science, literature but the important thing is the language. We learn just one language and spending almost the ten years for us to able to speak. For those years, we learn the basic how to speak in a formal way. Also our parent watch our behavior and manner along the way. When we reach to the puberty, mostly everything is start to change. The important thing is the way we thinking. Everything that we been learning from our parent, teacher, friend, society start to root inside our brain and also define who we are. One famous quote from smart human that we call him Buddha said "" You are what you think you are"". This quote not designed just for his religion but for the worldwide. If you think you can become success, you will be success one day. If you think you want to be a doctor, you will become a doctor one day. No matter what you say always say a good things to the people around you. No matter what you do always do a good things to the people around you. If you want the people to do or say a good things to you too. And everything is start from us the way we thinking. Positive attitude is an important key for all success in life. And for my experience whenever I feeling down, discouragement, disappointment, anxiety, hopeless I always repeat this quote to myself ""You are what you think you are"". So after that if I had a bad time I keep thinking to myself that I can get through it. Even you have a small chance to success just keep thinking to yourself that you can make it through. One student asked the teacher will I pass the test if I do not know anything and the teacher answer even if you know that you can not make it just go to the test center. When they hand out the test just do what you know. And after that you will know that you have at least 1 percent chance of passing the test.

In another reason, I daily uses my phone because it is easy to carrying It in the hallway instead of a big dictionary, and some dictionary does not contain the word that you looking for . Beyond of that, in the cellphone you just need to download the dictionary app or go the Google web and type easily the word that you need to fine information for. Therefore, cellphones can give many way to you how to understand the word specially the Google web site it can give you pictures, or it can led you to a video link where you can see resources that are explaining the meaning of the word or different manner that they can be clear at the point. I use Google a lot of time because has everything that the dictionary can not be included for example, Google translate can tell you the pronunciation, quickly to research, and even if it is bad it will tell you the meaning besides that if you dont know how to spell the word it contains an option where you can talk to the cellphone which is a lovely option to use. However, cellphones is a almighty thing to be used in the classroom to help students knowledge or everywhere. beside, been smart and having powerful resource we can learn from cellphones to do many things as some teachers want us to use our cellphones for Wikipedia, kahhot , dictionary web, and googlecassroom for reading , writing or gave us homework throw it.

And also, it can have a different variety of information and some teachers will ask for it during the class, if you have one .

There are some reason why I think that be accomplish is better. For some of the people be accomplish is hard to the people because they dont have to much time. First reason is, be better is because your learn more, you have more experience. We dont wait our time if we do more job if we have to do more job we doing it. We dont have to be to lazy for do more job if we can do the job. Just if we dont have to much time that will be just to done the work. To do accomplish to spend more time doing it. Whatever thing is if we have time we doing it. I work every day if I have to do more work I do it but if I dont have a time do to my work I just done whatever I am doing. Second reason is do more. do more can be extra work done that will be nice ti have extra work done for the next day if we do the same we dont have to do more. Extra work have to be complete by the time and then dependently what do you do about. When people do extra work in their job the make more money and also they make more overtime hours in their job but no all the job are the same. For me to do more work is more easy for one think I learn more for, another think I just do extra job because I have time and I like too. To more is when we the people have time Third reason is feelings, why feelings? feelings is because when we do more work that have to be we are satisfy. In other way we feel like when you make a goal when you done. We have emotional feeling when we done the thing what we doing it and also when we accomplish more. After you finish doing the work we feel tired but is not the same when we are satisfy for done. when I do my extra work always measure that is good.

Some reasons why I disagree is because you might have to do thing after school. Something are you might have sports practice for a team or for clubs.

Something else is that student can fall asleep and not pay attention to the teachers and they can get trouble as well as the student can stay even longer.

477,2823,BF01FFEF8CB3,"When you ask for advice, you ask multiple people right? I do. One of the reasons why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because when you ask more than one people for advice, they mostly give you different ideas and the more ideas you get from people the easier it feels to make that choice. Another reason why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is that when you ask different people for advice they would give you their own opinions about that choice. For example, if you ask your friend for advice for a choice you are going to make, that friend might tell you something positive about it, in the other hand, if you ask another friend for advice for a choice they might tell you something bad about it which will be way different than what your other friend said. The third reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if one person told you a negative advise and the other person told you a positive advise, you could pick which one you think is helpful. The fourth reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if you ask a friend for advice they can tell you their personal thoughts about that choice and if you ask another person they might give you their personal thoughts about it. For example, if you ask a friend to tell you if you should do your homework or not that friend might say ""No dont do your homework and lets hang out"" ,in the other hand, if you ask your other friend if you should do your homework or not he might say ""Yes do your homework because if you dont you might get a bad grade"", and then you would have to pick which one is better for you. To conclude, if you realy need advice, you should ask multiple people so then you could get more ideas.",7,6,6,6,6,8,2571,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

479,2825,53607F113053,"Although they say it is better to not try to redo things you already mastered then you will never grow,Actually it is better to retry something you already mastered,one example is you will have more experienced on the task your suppose to accomplish with. Another example is they would take you in as a responsible person. One of the following examples I mentioned was how you will have more experienced on the task your suppose to accomplish because having that experience their is so many things that can get done. With the experience you can multitask. In todays society people around the world have their own jobs and work and from now then have experienced the job. For me when I got my first job I didnt have no experience I did not know what I was doing so they trained me from then I started getting the hang of it I knew from then what my job was to do. Ive been working at Party City for a year already and I already have experienced even have the chance to become a manager from the store. All I know is that with experience things can get accomplished and turn out fine to the best things that get done. Another example that i mentioned was they can see you as a responsible person and they know what rights and wrongs you can show them. A responsible person can show so many ideas or reasons for someone to be that good person they expect themselves to be. In todays society that we live in their is so many people all around the world who are responsible for their actions they know what is best. For example when it comes to babysitting one of my siblings its a huge responsibility to take care just like how my parents left them for me thats how they want to come and find them. Its my job for them to make sure they dont get hurt and for me to have the time to feed them and to please them from the things they want. My mother calls me responsible since I know that I love kids and its my job to keep them safe. Responsibility matters in society good things can come your way if you honestly see yourself doing big things that are right in life. However the opposite of trying something you already mastered is ""If you dont retry something you mastered then you will never grow"" meaning wont get to accomplish what you could have accomplished more and wont experience new choices or things. The things that people in society do which in life it can come to a time that you have to redo something it is best to retry and if you dont it then you wont accomplish things meaning it wont take you nowhere cause you would forget other then that you wont get to experienced anything new that you couldnt accomplish. Through out society we know that its best to retry things and to keep completing the accomplishments that wanted to get done either its best to keep building up more experiences and to be come responsible person or to not even retry to do the things you were doing before which they would not get you nowhere. Through out life its a big chance which you can see yourself happy and from then having a smile on your face. People even complementing you about how well done things you accomplished. What I believe in is to never give up to retry things that were done before and that it can still be redone no matter what day it is in life, its always better to accomplish then to not even try.",6,7,7,7,5,7,1091,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

481,2827,5AC16E188F1B,"Today technology is arriving into the schools. Some schools offer distance leraning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think that this would benefit students? I believe that it would not benefit students because of technology distraction, student behavior, and the different in capacity and ability for a student to understand things. First reason, technology is an useful tool that people can use to learn or discover things, but it can be a huge distraction on young people. Today the technology is everywhere and it has everything which make it a powerful distraction for students. Also, the students can copy any work from the internet while they are taking their online classes. The students will not learn anything if they copy every single work from the internet. Most students on school classes get distracted really easy by something around him, and also get bored when the teacher explain a new theme. I believe that is going to be more bored and distracted being at home alone doing conference and watching videos about the class. My home can distracted me more than my phone or computer, most kids have a video game, TV, family, and so others things that can catch their attention. Second reason, student behavior can be a problem with online classes. A lot of students do not respect or listen to their teacher at school, and I am not wrong thinking that it would be the same at home with online classes. Most of this students do not listen to their teacher because they do not understand the way that the teacher explain or they do not like the teacher. So you can have an idea of how worst it can be i will give you an example, if a student do not like the subject of the day he can easily end the video conference with his teacher or he can just not listen to what he is explaining. The student can also not enter in to the class at the right time. I believe the there should be someone near the student to tell them what to do and how to do it. Last reason, not all students have the same capacity to understand things. Not all the students have the same capacity to learn or understand by just watching videos or looking at pictures. I am a person who need someone to be physically near by so he or she can tell me how to do things. All the students that have this disability would be affected by this type of classes and this would make them to loose their credit on the class. At the same time this new type of classes is creating a barrier between students, teachers, and school. Conclusion, the online classes do not benefit students because it can create a barrier between students, teachers, and school. The technology used for this programs can generate a distraction, and that can be a huge problem on future, the environment and behavior of the student can be a barrier too, and the different in capacity or ability to understand things can also represent an huge problem. At the end non one benefit from this online courses. ",7,7,7,7,7,7,1173,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
482,2828,277A95AC0190,"I agree that the possitive attitude is the key to sucess in life. The reason why a lot of people agree with me in this subject, is because lot of people that have a negative attitude or minset, their thoughs or ideas would always be negative. All those people would never be sucess in life, because no matter what they would like to do in life or the ideas they have in their head that they wanna do in life. All thoose people would always have that negative spot in their head, that would not let them success in life, all those people would have to work two times harder to make it to the end, to make their dreams come true and sucess in life. Out of 100% of pople that have a negative attitude or minset, only 10% would sucess in life, the other 90% would not be able to sucess in life.

They wanna be a good example for their kids, they wanna show their kids that no matter how hard life gets, they do not need to give up or have a bad attitude in life, because that would not help them to be successful in life, that they need to stay positive no matter what and always keep their attitude and minset postitive, that if they stay positive, they would success in life and would make all their dreams come true.

483,2829,FE1D0E5EA2EB,"The Author Waldo Emerson wrote ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". I agree with Waldo Emersons quote because if theres someone thats trying to make you something that your not, being yourself will be a very duanting task. When I was in the 8th grade someone who I thought was one of my friends wanted me to change who I was because they though that I wasnt cool enough to hangout with anymore, at first i thought that I was the problem, but I learned that true friends wont try to change who you are, no mather what. Being yourself is one of the hardest things you can try to do, possible because your to shy, you dont think your good enough, your scared of what others will think of you. I always hated thinking about myself because i never though that I was good enough for anyone or good enough to do anything, so I kept everything bottled up inside, at one point or another I even thought about killing myself but was to scared to do antthing to try anything. So I decided acted like everything was ok untill I tricked my self into belaveing that I was happy, but that didnt last. Now im in the 11th grade I came across a certen individuality(my current girlfriend) who, when I around, cant stop feeling real happyness. Everyday I think about how lucky I am to have met her. The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, as an individual I agree with his quote because in this world not everone wants to see you sucssed in your efferts.",6,9,7,7,7,6,3858,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 9, cohesion 6"
484,2830,B558AFC603D4,"There was a girl named Generic_Name, and she wanted to play violin like she used to. Generic_Name was struggling. It was not easy on getting back to playing it. Generic_Name practiced everyday no matter what. Generic_Name made a lot of mistakes on the way, but successed at the end. When you accomplished something; you have failed before you could have successed. Failing can cause before you succeed because you try to get where you are, you make mistakes, and you can make the wrong choices. To begin, failing can lead to succes because it happen before you succeed. For an example, you tell yourself that you will get your work done for all of your classes. Then you end up not understanding the work, but tried and turned it in the work. It can also be doing all your chores before you could go out and be with your friends. For another example, you had a lot of chores to do. It was getting late and you have finished all of your chores. At the end you could not go out, but finshed with all of the chores. It can also deal with reading a book. For an example, you want to read a hard book and finsh it, but you end up reading a different level and finshed the book. These examples show that you fail before you can succeed. Secondly, failure happens before you can accomplish anything because everyone makes mistakes. It can be when someone is trying to make a cake. For an example, you try to combine the inderigdeints, but they were not the right indergridents, Then next time, they put in the right inderigents. It can also be about when someone is trying to practice on their drving skills. For an example, The driver prcatices everyday, but makes many mistakes. Later on, gets better at it. People can aslo make mistkes by giving poeple directions on where to go. For an example, a lady needed help to get the location at the supermarket. The lady asked an old man where it was. The old man gave the direction, but made a mistake where the superamlrket was at. Then the old man told the lady that it was the other way. All of these examples show that mistakes can happen before you can success. Lastly, failing can cause by just making the wrong choice. Such as a girl wanted to tryout for outdoor track, but she loved playing softball. The girl tried out for track and made the team. There was a problem, she couldn[t be on the softball team because it was too late. The softball teamwas full. At the end, the girl should of made a better choice. It can also be about how you want to turn out your day. For an example, the boy wanted his day to be fun, but the boy was paying attention in his classes so he was sent to the offfice. This turned out to a bad day. Then he apologized and made his day better. This all shows that making the wrong choices can lead to failing on what you decide. This all sums up, that failure can cause before you succeed. Others say that failure does not happen when you succeed, however, I say that it does play out before you can success. Failing will always occur when you succeed. You push yourself where you want to be, you make errors, and doing the wrong decision are all reasons why failure can happen before you can success. Do you think there is failure even when you succeed. ",8,8,6,7,7,6,2442,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

486,2832,DBDBF971510B,"It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Imagine starting a new school year; students are ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to see their friends. It comes time to pick up their schedule and they see that there is some classes that they really would not like to take but those classes are required for them to take. A students starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes are required. I believe students should not be required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only affect them but it would also affect their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class but they would not put in the effort they need in order to recieve the credit. In many cases, students who do not like the classes they are taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. Having good grades is what makes your GPA great. We all know that having good grades and keeping a good GPA is very important when it comes to college and universities. Students will need to attend a college or a university in order to get a good paying job. By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not fall in their career field. For example, a student might want to work at a fast food restuarant in the future but in high school this students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal of working at a fast food restuarant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist of course. Secondly, if you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just wont show up that whole school day. Having good attendance is also very important to have because if students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class. If a students keeps skipping the class they do not like, their grades get worse because they are not recieving the work they need to due to skipping class and their attendance keeps worsening which will only get them into bigger trouble. For instance, where I live if a student does not show up to school for more than fifteen days they get put into a juvenile detention center. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motive a student to come to school because they are really not learning anything important from those classes. Lastly, every high school student knows that they need a certain amount of credits in order to graduate. In order to recieve those credits a students grades, GPA, and attendance must be excellent. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motivate a student to get good grades, good GPA, or good attendance. If anything making these classes required will only make these students less motivated into coming to school and earning those high school credits. In conclusion, forcing or requiring students to take these classes that should be electives would affect them mentally. It would affect them mentally because they might not be as good as the other people in that class. Students should not be required to take such classes like art, music, or drama; those classes should stay as electives. Helping every student learn new material, graduate, and get them into college should be our main focus instead of making them take classes they do not need to.

The pros are that you learn more its good because schools get out earlier for the summer so their more summer days to enjoy. Another pro is if you have question on your homework the teacher can help you out by teaching you and you dont have to worry about the time because you have plenty of minutes to learn. Second If their were longer classes kids will lean more things and pay attention,if its their favorite class well it will be good for them because its longer. For me I love music class if i have more time in that class i could learn more things about music and i could be better player. Third pro it give us more time to hang out with our friends because your could be busy because they sports or church. Well for me i cant hangout with my friends because i have strict parents they wont let me get out of the house unless i have good also they dont let me hang out with friends so the only way i can see them is at school. Fourth pro is you can get to know your teacher and the students in the class you can learn many new thing about the teacher that you would never know about sometime its cool to hear their story because it could teach you something or can make you laugh. So i learn that their many good thing of having more time in a school day. The cons of having one hour and thirty minutes in school day. First con is kids will be tired and they wont think that much or pay attention because all their energy is gone. The kids will be rude and wont do anything because they are tired or hungry. Well the only way to fix this to give them snack yeah that could help but how your going get the snack you have to buy them with money they are going to tell the kids to buy the snacks and the schools wont buy it. Second con is if the kid has doctor appointment they will go and the next day they will miss a lot of stuff in class and they make it up and the teacher wont teach it again because they have to move on and learn something new. Third con is classes will be harder because you have remember a lot of stuff for the test that your going to have that week. Honestly for me everyday when i get home i take a nap if dont have that nap i will be mad all night so many other kid could be just like me when they dont get a nap they are really rude so that bad for them ant the teachers also you will see kids falling asleep and teacher will yell at them. So i learn that their many not so great things of having more time in school. In the end they are many good like getting help for work and their may bad things like getting tired.

In the summer sometimes is ,so hot that it can reach the temperature of 100 degrees. Most of the people living in Puerto Rico are use to the hot temperature. Next, you would see people in the beachs or at the river some people have pool but some people cant buy pools because some dont have money and some people do have money so when the weather is hot you will see most of the people at the beachs or rivers.

Other school subjects should do that because people pay more attention to it nobody likes having a teacher sit there and give you a packit to learn nothing all day. Science expreiments are the best because you see whats happening and your getting it more. It makes it better to get a hands on activty then just looking at a book all the time. I feel like more people have As than Fs in science because the experiment helps people alot. Over all its just a better than to do because helps peoples grade helps them understand what they are trying to teach them. I personally like science expreiments more than any other classs becasue it helps me have an A in that class. Other people like it because people in my scince class always get happy when the teacher says we do have an expreiment to do.

492,2838,BFB07811C92D,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people think that they can control there first impressions at any time that they wanted to, but thats is not right, first impressions are so fast that it does not let you think, or express in a different way they are faster them a second, there are impressions that can be change, but it depends in the situation that you are in, and other can not be change no matter what you do. I agree with this statement, because impressions are an affect, feeling or image retained after an experience. Some impressions had a really bat affect in our lives, less say there was a time were maybe the only impression that some had was really not the one he wanted, but was the only one he could do, for example let say that there is a student in a classroom, maybe he is not feeling good, and he fart that it makes a realy loud some, and that everyone in the class hear it, his first impression will be to act normal but he could not act normal, because he knows that it was so loud that everyone heard him, so his going to feel shame of him self, his face is going to get red, and his hears and but thats something you can not control. The feeling that some get at the firs impression is almost like something you dont have every day, well if you have embarrassing moment every time them you may get the wired feeling every day. Went you get the firs impression and is not every day situation is almost all time shame, confusion, uncomfortable, some times pain. But when is a every day thing, them is almost all the time happynes, like the feeling I get went my family ask me embarrassing questions or we have embarrassing moments. Is almos all the time happiness. Because it is a very day thing that they ask me things that it makes me uncomfortable. The experiences that people get went they have a lot of firs impressions, are so impressive that they can act normal in a lot of situation, for example went they were use to act embarrass or shame now they are capable to act normal, because of the experience that they had. Like I personable had a lot of experience that now insted of feel shame or embarrass I only get happiness. like went my mom ask me if i had a girlfriend I only smile or answer her that i do not and it is all normal, or at school went my friends ask me if Im dating the girl I like, the answer I give them is yes or not, like a normal student, I dont get shame or anything. Because I had some experience during my life that it make me feel normal now. I hope that in the future one day, when someone ask me something embarrass, and make me get a moment when my first impression is shame, or embarrass my feeling dont show up, and my experiences take place, for it not to have more affect in the moment, and make it more embarrassing than what it is already, because I dont want it to make me lost my mine, and make the moment the worst one in my life.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students from home by way of online video conferencing I think, students are not going to have any benefit to attent classes from home. some of the studends have to work, do stuff at home, or stay in school on other activities. students sometimes, actually need some help with some classes but they might not like to be taking the classes at home, The studend taking the class at home could get distracted by so many things at his house. While some other studends that have better grades and like school they could take the class, but they also will have homework and things to do at home.

498,2844,BA5DC45B0E3F,"Our character develop sometimes by our own choices, and other times it develops by the influences in life, we can choose what kind of a person we want to be either good or bad, some choose to be both you cant really pick a side and stay at it , theres good in every bad and theres bad in every good. Some choose to be bad because they think if they choose to be a good person people will take advantage of them since good people always the ones who cares so much , help others all the time , and think about people happiness before theirs. Theyre wrong in my opinion because being a good person is better than being bad who are most likely the selfish ones that dont care about anyone except themselves. But in my opinion having a character isnt just about being a good or a bad person , its about having a good personality , loving yourself and loving people , making others happy , having a positive energy , but also most importantly not forgetting about yourself. No one can really have a perfect character everyone got a dark side in them but only show it when needed , like if they were hurting or something bad happened to them or any other life reasons, thats if you choose your own character and choose to be good or bad. Sometimes you really cant choose your own character because the influences of life will choose it for you nothing will be in your control , it all depends on the life you were born in , like your culture , religion , and the people around you , but thats not all sometimes the way life goes is the reason your character change you can choose to be something and lifes decisions will choose something else for you , life can be like a puzzle it never lets anyone stay as they are , they always change , grow up , be mature , or things that happens with them in life will make them grow up even if theyre young or still not an adult yet. For me I think age isnt the thing but a number , the thing that make you mature is your character and the way you think , if life didnt force you to have a specific character then choose your own character and make it different dont try to copy someone else and be life them , just be you , be different its more beautiful.",7,6,7,7,7,6,2507,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

501,2847,49718724CB84,"Does the people that have mastered something can grow, even if they do not try nothing else? Some people believe they are very okay only with what they have mastered. People knows they could master one profession, but they also know they wont grow in nothing else if they do not try nothing else. If someone decides to only master in one thing that is okay, but that persons knowledge will only increase on what he master, nothing else. People cannot grow if their mindset is stuck with what they mastered and they wont increase in knowledge. People cannot grow more if they stick only with what they mastered. For example, Ms. Generic_Name, a really good looking woman, had a store for plants and she also teaches about plants. One day Ms. Generic_Name had to let some kids know that the plants do not grow by itself, people make them grow. She called the kids to the back of the store to show them apples seed. Ms. Generic_Name told the kids that she used to take care of them but she stopped, because she thought that once the plants grow enough, she would not have to deal with that again. She saw the plant standing and she thought her work was done. She did not take care of her plants no more because she thought they were okay in that position, but she did not know that the plants were not gonna grow more. That is exactly what happen with people that mastered something and they just stick with that, they did not try nothing else and now they are just steady they cant grow no more. Thus, if people believe they are okay with what they mastered and they dont try nothing else, they wont grow no more. Knowledge is one of the things that mostly deals with growth. For example, Ms. Generic_Name had the knowledge of every plant. At first Ms. Generic_Name did not know that she had to take care of them, at least until they could be strong enough. Now that she have years on plants she knows a lot. She did not want to stick with what she knew and now she is grown in knowledge. She is in college studying more about different types of plants from other countries. Thank to her enthusiasm for plants, Estency Generic_Name is now one of the biggest specialist on plants in the world. Nobody should be comfortable with knowing just what they want to know, people should start seeking more for knowledge based on what they want, just as Ms. Generic_Name did. Some people may say that people could grow if they have mastered only once, because they only need whatever they have passion for, or whatever they want to do. For example,Generic_Name went to college with the dream of being a constructor and he graduated from college, now he is a constructor but not how he wanted to. Generic_Name could have being an architect but he decided to be less; however, people should seek for knowledge and not only stick with one master. People could get master at something but after that people have to be open to learn knew things every day. In conclusion, people will never grow if they do not try out. A persons knowledge increase with the amount of time and interest. Knowledge is one of the things that most deals with growth.

503,2849,89857315A1A4,"How to distribute forty work hours a week most usefully? Nowadays, a four-day work week is very rare, because this system is new; people always being careful when something new come out, but then they understand it is better. The four-day schedule is more balanced, energy and money saving and variable. This is why, I believe, our school should should follow the new schedule. First, the forty-day school week is more well-distributed, because the students would have more time for rest, doing homework; so their ability to study will have been raised. On another hand, ten hours in school might be exhausting for the pupils, but the school administration may make breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of tired students Second, the four-day schedule lowers the use of energy and resources. The school would use less electricity to heat and cool the building; it will spent less money for servicing the students and investigate saved money to science researches, equipment and study program development. Third, with the sour-day schedule the pupils become more free: they might share more time with their family and friends; spent more time for their hobbies and working. The students may hardly learn if they are late for making project or plan the interesting and fun weekend in the three days; the bad thing about rest four days: you will not rest. School days will be very busy, hard; but maybe more educational and efficient. Long ten hours in school might be uncomfortable for the students, who do extra curriculum activities like preparing courses, art clubs and sports. However, our school has all comfortabilities to do extra curriculum activities inside the schools building, so the students do not need to go anywhere else. To conclude, the four-day school week seems experimental for people yet; but when something new is thought the people realize an idea is innovative, then the idea becomes an action, which becomes regular.

For Example;Generic_Name she is school home and she all time in home she doesnt have any friend she talk with her mother and father and her mother father is agree with she and she start to go school and she find alot friend and she understand better then befor.

511,2857,F91EFD0443E6,"Have you ever though of people who use technology has limit their communication to others? Nowadays people who use technology are consistent spending their time on electronic device. Technology has a negative impact on human lives due to their daily routine. The first reason is peoples communication skills will decrease over time. Spending a lot of time on technology without comminicating with others, will affect your communication skills. Therefore, talking to someone who you havent talked with for a while can be awkward. This shows that understanding between two people might have consequence and will be not accurate than it should be. The second reason, people who use electronic device are unlikely aware of the surroundings. For example, people who are walking in street using headset or earbuds on that cover their ears is a bad choice. This shows a sign of danger, because you wont be hearing anything. People who are aware of surrounding are more safe to cross a street and communicate with people who are passing by. This shows a negative effect of people who block their earing has higher chance to get into a accident. Some people say that technology helps them communicate by commenting on a website which is true, but that is not important because the person will be not always active and able to comment back on time, whenever they are on. If you are communicate in person you can read the persons mood. You can get a faster respond than waiting for the person to comment back. In this way is more accurate and able to trust each other more by communicating in person that you have meet or have not meet before. The final reason is library is more accurate than reading books online. For example like reading online recommendation is not always accurate because of the peoples preferance. You can ask the librarian for recommendation and librarian also assist you whenever you need help. You can read on your device but it is limited because of the battery. Unlike books, have no battery which means it doesnt have any limit. This shows reading on books is a better than reading on a device. In conclusion technology had a negative effect on people lives. People should be aware that around them and spend their time in their technology on a necessary way. There should be a limit of how much time you are using on technology. Is better to communicate in person and dont wear anything that cover your ears while talking to someone. This affect our daily lives, so limit the time you use in technology.",7,7,9,6,7,8,3747,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
512,2858,9FA90B94782E,"Wow! A talent I have is soccer, I have played soccer when I was born. Loved to play the sport because It always entertained me. So then I started playing more and more of it, and then I started playing in tournaments and leagues. I started of in defense, then I started to up my way up, so then in three weeks I started playing striker. When I started playing soccer I used skills like communication,passing and shooting so then my coach said I had potential in me. So then I started to watch soccer in my T.V..Soccer got famous in the late 1800s. Also in soccer you had to work hard and train hard. Like professionals they worked for 5 to 8 hours a day. Well in soccer games I use communicating,dribbling,passing and shooting. In my opinion communicating is the most important soccer talent professionals need. Professionals need communication to score or win a match. For example my soccer team always use communication to pass to even score, and to win the match. Pele was a young Brazilian when he went to the world cup finals, he was only 18. His position was striker, he was known for his bicycle kick in the 80 minute. In 1900 professional in different leagues used communication also to pass to ball. Everybody needs communication to win any sport game. In my opinion you need skills to be good at the game. In one of my games I had to score two goals at least to win the finals in soccer then I two use my skills called the fake. In 2009 there was a player named Lionel Messi he plays for Generic_City and won six ballon dor. He used skills in games and in training. In my other soccer matches I used skills like passing and dribbling in a soccer matches. There was a player named Ronaldo he played for Generic_City when I was born, so I saw one of his soccer games in the T.V and I looked how he used other skills in the match against Generic_City. So I trained for an hour before my soccer tournament. So then I used one of his skills and it worked. So I used his skills for two games. So I saw professional players skills, so I can use those professional skills in a soccer game. In my opinion you have to work hard and train hard because if I dont I wont be active so those are my other soccer skills because I train to learn moves, running, and defense. I train everyday so I can get better and better. Other professional have to train everyday to win other soccer matches and communicate with other teammates. I also practice dribbling a lot in my soccer practice. I use it a lot in soccer matches and I really good at it. In 2008 there was a player called Alex Hunter he was a rookie, then he started training and training until he gotten famous and good at soccer. I train everyday when that happened to someone. If everybody tried to play soccer it wouldnt be boring because its fun, you can play with family members or friends, and you can know new people.",7,7,8,6,5,7,2136,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

People that have enthusiasm will most likely to take the quote to their own hearts that doesnt want to quit or gives up yet. Like the quote says from failure to failure that will follow up to a pursuit of success. So here comes the reasons of enthusiasm in the quote. Learning something new that actually comes up great. A lot of people learn from their own failures in the past for doing something that wasnt easy for their own lives. Like example someone wants to speak a different language but failed many times,that actually doesnt wants to give up on the language that trying to learn. And its better to make mistakes for something greater later in life. Like if you failed a lot and that you learn from your own mistakes from those mistakes will do something greater in the future. Others may disagree that quote doesnt fit right their own selves and for being negative. Others careless about the enthusiasm how it will help for their lifetime. So they dont have the positive attitude and thinks about nothing at all. Negativity is the main point that they fail to fail without trying the best and the enthusiasm with them in life its worthless to them in life.

In my opinion, the technology had negative effects on peoples lives, because the technology had been corrupt the mind, also expose the life of people. in the actuality the people act like robots. Most of the time, they do not think by them self. In addition the interaction between family and friends is been losing a cause of social media or videos games. However many people think the opposite, they think live before without technology the people was illiterate, and they think the technology is a progress for the world. The technology brought a lot of invents like explore the human body, talk with the people that is not near from us, or maintain informed what happens in another place, Even still the technology is giving us a lot of sources like buy things without leave the house, but the technology is had been negative effects on peoples live because nowadays many people, most kids and teenagers they do not think by them self. One of many example of that is when you ask a girl or a boy about something really important how it is, if the water has energy? Most of the teenagers is going to answer yes, and I know this because in my science class the teacher asked this question, and everyone in the classroom answers yes, but the teacher said the water does not have energy, and she explains why, but no one has convince and what she told, so they look in Google and they arrived the conclusion what the teacher say was correct. The point with this example is to see nowadays the people believe more and what Google or other things what form part of the technology say. if the people need a solution to solve any problem, they actually do not think about it. they go to the internet and look for solution. another negative effect of the technology in the daily life is the interaction. I am going to expose my family and friends. when i spend time with my family and friend, they always happens in their cellphones, they do not pay attention around of their behavior. They lose the notion of their time and everything a cause of the social media even my brother he does not want to go out and play soccer or to walk, because he is more interesting to play videos games or watch videos. In actuality a cellphone is indispensable to live. to do moments that suppose there are good moments, or that is the people believe, but they forget the feeling to talk, to joke without check their cellphone every two minutes. We slowly losing our feelings, our taste for life, our friends, our family, and even our jobs. In addition the technology expose our private life. Example is for every transition you do, you need to give your personal information. The social media is turn in our worst enemy because across of the internet many people has been bullied for the videos or picture that they shared until to lead the people to suicide. in conclusion the technology is our worst tool to improve ourself. The time of Elbert Einsteins was afraid is coming soon. The technology is opaquing our intellect. The technology is turn into robots without the capacity to think by ourself. thanks to the technology the humanity is turn in unselfish, unsuccessful, and unsure of themself.

519,2865,D16B3304A010,"A positive attitude is the key to success in life. Can you imagine the world without positivity? Some people are doing successful achievements through the positive attitude, but others have a discrepancy to that. I believe that positivite attitude is important because positivity points to the healthy mental health, genial and successful accomplishments. To begin with first reason, there are successful and unsuccessful people in the world. We are all humans, and we all have feelings, strenghts, weakneasses. Usually, those weaknesses make me stronger and give me lessons, and good lessons bring the keys to the successful doors. Life is like a school, teaches, tests, grades. However, my attitude decides who I want to be, but the importance is in being positive. Another reason, ""being positive"" for me means being patient. For example, the person who is admiring me everytime. He is my father. I know all of his experiences connected with his job. There were a diffucult times too but because of his positive attitude, he is at proffessional level of his military career. I remember, when he had strict bosses, not very loyal friends, when we had the money shortgage. My parents teach me everytime: ""It doesnt matter where are you, be mature show them respect, take your community to the positive sides, be kind. Therefore, it will help you to be successful"". On the other hand, some people say that the world is diffucult and success is not in the positivity because there are other things like money, good community, good education. Yes, that is true, but thinking positive and having efforts to accomlish something, that is already success. Success doesnt mean being rich and eminent. For me success is when I follow my dreams, help people, motivate them to be positive. However, there is the times when there is no place positivity, like loosing someone, or being unresponsible for something, hurting someones feelings. Eventually, to be successful in life, I have to stay positive in difficult situations. I like to be humor ,when I want to cry. I am responsible for my life and I choose positivity to achieve accomlpishments to be better and helpful to the community because that would help me to be successful and success makes the bliss!",8,7,6,7,8,8,2894,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

However, some say school shouldnt offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldnt get enough knowledge at home, its better in school.

523,2869,5098F28A2EF3,". It has been said that 1st Impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement to me is wrong. Impressions can be changed not only because people always mature in life, but also people may change by others actions, and they way life treats one another. Impressions can be changed because people mature in life. For example, my mother tells me all the time that I was not the same kid she raised because of my appearance and the way I act around others. So, it is because I have matured that I have changed, if I was 7 or 8 years old, I would be shay to talk to people and try to be polite to not cause problems. Also, people would never smoke or even talk back if their impressions matter like they did when they were little. So peoples impressions change when you get mature in life Impressions can be changed because of the people around them. For example, my little brother may not do all the things that he does now if it werent for my behavior around others, back then my little brother would be very shay to speak. Then he saw how I spoke to others; with security, courage, and calm. He learned that from me and now he talks to anyone he enjoys hanging out with. So, with people being and influence in someones life, you would make a good or a bad impacted on someones life which would change someones impression for sure. Impressions can be changed because the way life treats one another. For example, a week from my birthday I was going to turn 14 my dad got arrested; I did not feel like I wanted to throw a party, I hated everything cause I said to my self life isnt fair, Then the next morning in school, every ones impression of was that I never felt sad, I was a happy young teen; Until the next day everyone was wishing me a happy early birthday. I didnt feel happy about it because my mind was all caught up on my fathers arrest. People noticed that and their impression changed because I never felt happy in my life, everything went wrong. Instead of everyone greeting me every morning, they just gave me space because they thought that I was depressed and I was for a good time. Now people take me seriously now because I didnt make jokes. So peoples impression changes ever since they saw the way life wasnt fair. In conclusion, It has been said that 1st Impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement to me is wrong. Impressions can be changed not only because people always mature in life, but also people may change by others actions, and they way life treats one another. All of these reasons are true because no one really knows what life, maturity, and the people around you can do to affect someones 1st impressions of you.",8,7,8,6,8,7,1058,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

Homework clubs can help students understand their work better and have more confidence with it. The homework club would have to start at the end of the day when everyone has their homework,the club can be from 3:00pm to 5:00pm that way students have 2 hours to get their work done and have time to chill out at home. I am sure that many other people agree that we should have a homework club. We all know this would be a great opportunity for students that have a difficult time understanding their work. Homework clubs can also help students improve grades which will then lead to higher test scores all because students will get extra help and have someone who will help them understand their work better.

526,2872,BA0D3D6A8A94,"I disagree with this plan. I say this because the amount of hours we come to school everyday is enough. If the school board add another hour and a half to the school day all students will be tired, and the students would not be able to learn everything during the day. Being in school for a long period of time and getting homework would put a lot of pressure on the students. For most students the amount of time we come to school at the moment is already putting a lot of pressure. If the school board add another hour and a half most of the students will surely dislike school and maybe even drop out or show no interest in school work or homework. Students would also have a very short amount of time to study for tests or the big projects that they have to finish outside of school at home because some students have a part time job. Students need some free time for their happiness and physical health. As a middle school student I can say that I get to have free time and do my school work just fine at the moment but with getting one hour and a half added to my school schedule I dont know if I would still have the time to have fun and do my school work and still manage time to spend with my family and friends. It would effect my health if I dont get enough free time to play with my friends or do the things I like. For those students who have a part time job wont be able to spend enough time with their family or friends or get some time to rest. It would surely effect their mental health, physical health and happiness because they are not going to get enough time to work out or do something fun to rest their mind. Teachers with part time job would have a difficult time on teaching students their best and having a part time job. Mostly all teachers have a part time job because they have a big family and their income from teaching is not enough or they want to save money. All of them have their personal reasons for it. But teachers can not have a good part time job if the school board add another hour and a half to the school day Because teachers must stay after school at least once or twice a week to help the students that needs help or want to take a retake on a test. Teachers will not have enough time for a good part time job or to really take good care of their kids for the ones that are married. The ones that are not married to just take good care of their mom and dad. So teachers would either have to quit teaching or get their salaries increased. So they wouldnt need a part time job to earn more money and they would have time to take good care of their family. Drivers already are taking a risk for driving in the morning when its dark. Its very difficult for them to drive a school bus thats full of students when they cant really see the road. Adding one hour and a half is the last thing that the bus drivers need on their plate even if the school board adds one hour and a half to school day its okay for the bus drivers. But whats not okay is the after school program. After school program is for two hours and with adding one hour and a half to the school day thats three hours and thirty minutes later than the normal time. It would be really dark. So it would be really hard for bus drivers to drive and it would be too risky. It would be dangerous for the bus drivers and all the students that is going to be in it. After school is a program that helps every student make up missing work, retake a test or redo their homework to bring up your grades. It also help the school finish their work quick when students stay to help for their serves hours. But sadly the schools might have to shut down after school program if they add a hour and a half to school day because it would be hard for teachers, bus drivers and students. Students wouldnt stay after school because by the time the school finishes all the students would be really tired.",8,8,9,8,9,8,2501,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
527,2873,D7301CAAFAB0,When are parents gave us advice we are able to learn do the right thing. For example if you go work with your dad he gave you advice. Also they gave us advice we learn how to do the right thing. Learning the right thing helps us to make our life better. Learn something from more then one person because they help you dont get in trouble and be a good student or son if you learn from someone us. Learning advice from school is good because everyone learns and get good grades. Do something good for school is good because when they gave you advice to do the right thing is class. For example the gym teacher gave you advice to do the right not the bad advice because if you do the bad thing you will get a bad grade and get in trouble. When we get in trouble is bad and you always have to listen when they gave us advice for you do well at your test. When we do well in our test is because the teacher was having us advice and we were paying attecion. Friends gave us advice out side of school and inside school. When friends gave us advice inside school is because they want a better life for us. When friends gave us advice for our life is because they want us to be happy and be a better person. Also when they gave us advice like when we play sports. When we play sports the coach always have advice do win the game. When coaches gave us advice to play good and win games that teams will be come so good if the players get the advice of the coach. When people ask for advice is because they want to know what things are better like to buy. If we shop somewhere then you need a advice from someone to know if is good or bad. When they gave a advice of food you have to know if is good or bad for our health. If we dont get a advice like for something maybe will be bad for us to eat or do and may have problems. The person who do not gave a advice of what they doing they will get in trouble if good for our body or not good. When we are in math class the students gave us advice same with the teacher. Sometimes students gave us advice how to do the work of the problem more than one student gave us advice. When teacher shows advice of our class work how to do it and know when test are coming for be ready. Also the bus driver gave us advice how to act inside the bus. If the bus driver does not gave advice everyone in the bus will act crazy and maybe a accident.

529,2875,9EBCC1131B13,"As we have two different people, we have two types of parents that one of them, they believe and they force their children that should take some classes like music, drama, or an art class instead of elective classes. But another parents they do not believe and force them to take those classes. On the other hand we have some students that they like to take elective classes instead of those classes; and in opposite, we have students that they do not like to take elective classes. In general, as we know the place of schools, we can easily discover that students need have some classes that they want to be and they like to enjoy it and has fun and exciting for them. Here are some reasons that is showed why they have to take those classes; like music, a drama, or an art class. First reason is if they took those classes, they can decrease their stress that they have in their life and their school. Second reason is, they can easily figure out what skills are they have in their life and out of the main classes in school. Third reason is, if they really learned from those classes, they can teach to another persons and get money for that. Fourth reason is, it is good for their health from all aspects. Fifth reason is, it gives them energy; so they can always be active in their life specially in their school. First, on the other hand, some students is special because maybe they came from another country or have special condition that they not required to take those classes because they have to graduate or because of their English language; so they have to study and practice more; and they can not require to take those classes. They have to take main and elective classes that their counselor suggested to them. for example, I came from another country so I have to practice more in my English language and other main classes that I have in school, for these reasons I could not take an art, music or a drama class. Second, another students just take those classes because their parents want to, so these students can not learn and enjoy from those classes and even they will hate from those classes. for example, I saw my friends that he took a music class but he did not like that, but their parents force and required him to take that class, in summary he fell from all classes that he had in his school, and finally he did not graduate from school because of that. Third, some students that know English language include writing, speaking and listening, and has all As in their main classes like Physics, Math and Chemistry and another main classes, they can take music, an art or a drama class. As I said some benefit of those classes on above, they can improve their skills and they can go in forward to their life that they want to be. Finally, those classes can be help students a lot, but it has hinge on their status, and no one should not force students to take those classes unless they want to and they like to take those classes. In conclusion, those classes should not be compulsory, because in general, each work should has be with love, until we can learn and help others and improve ourselves.

530,2876,37A8D06A04AC,"What do you think about benefits of working with a group or working alone? Every country, every school, every teachers have teaching for students how to working together to playing games on assignment. And games can make for students likely work together to create atmosphere funny, if they working with a atmosphere new, they could be give some ideas faster and learning better. Why we need to teaching them the way like that? If we did not teaching the students working with a group, what happen will be? Almost the students really like working alone than working with a group. Because they think they can give some idea bad, and they dont want somebody complain when they do something wrong. If parents or teachers dont teaching them working with a group and believe by them self, they will never successful on the way they are. When Bill Gate was young, him learning about software and computer, when him did not have more idea. Bill Gate told friends about working with him, Bill Gate said: We could be create something new about software and computer. After two years, they could be create the new computer and software. Five years later, Bill Gate become rich people in the world. If Bill Gate did not told friends working with him, than we never know about software and computer like him created that. Bill Gate said: If the war appears, you did not working together, your country will be lost. Why we necessary to working with a group? Because working with a group might be make your love each other and understand when you work. When a group understand each other, they would be do some project better and always will be on time. Like a company they never have one people working in there, because one people could not be do some project better a group. Every people working in company, they never working with alone, because they dont know where you fail when you writing essay. Thats why we need a group can fix your fail and make you do better in your job. When you working with a group, you can learning some ideas your friends talking and the way they working. Danial Williams Hale said: Everything you learn, everything you practice, its would be help you some case. If you like working with a group, you can learning skill about your friends, you will be easy to successful on the goals. Like playing games, they need a team working together, if one people in a team like working alone, they can make your team loser. If you like working with a group, you will be have more friends and second language if your friends from another country. If in the world, we dont working together, maybe the world war three will be occur and the peaceful never got in the world. And we will never know culture of another country.

532,2878,E8B0698217A3,"They say the you should never judge a book by its cover and, especially regarding people, its true. In this case, the cover is not necessary meaning the appearance, but the first impression of another person. Like the cover of a book, first impressions are not always as appealing as what is really there. its not until after you start ""reading"" or get to know someone, when you really find out that what you see is not always what you get. There are several factors that can affect the first impression that one receives from another. Differing personality, situations and representation of a person, make impressions often the worst means of judging people. A persons personality has a big effect on the first impressions that they emit. Everybody is different but when it comes down to it first impressions are really based off of whether you are shy or not. I met my best friend after moving during my junior year, at my new high school. Before i knew her, she never said a word to me or anyone else in the classes that she was kind of odd, but then realized that I was the same way, i didnt talk to many people either because of my personality. I knew that I was shy person and after I get to know someone, I put down my front and show my true colors. I thought that maybe she would be same way. After starting to talk to her a little more each day, our friendship grew and I learned that she wasnt odd at all, but just like me an outgoing person hidden by their shyness. Some people like me and my friend, are shy and put up a reserved and quiet front when facing new people. Based on my first impressions of my friend, I thought something that was far from the truth. One who has a shy personality might in reality be outgoing, but uncomfortable showing it at first, making the first impression of that person a mistaken one. Your first impression of someone is not suitable because you do not know the situation they may be in. When seeing or meeting someone new, you have no idea the kind of day, difficulties or kind of disappointment that person may be experiencing. They may have have recently lost someone, or could be someone new and yet still have to deal with the routines and stresses going through out their day. All of these situations can create a barrier between themselves and others, and setting of a good impression is probably not at the top of their list of important things to do. On my first day of senior year, I walked hurriedly to my first class, even thought I had plenty of time to get there. When I walked into my class, the only thing on my mind was to find a seat right away, no matter if it was by another person or not. when the time come to eat lunch, I sat by myself and ate it quickly so I could proceed to my next class. I was so worried about being late for a class, finding a seat and just doing things right, that i didnt have time to try to leave any good first impression, on any of my peers. It wasnt even on my mind to do so. My peers received the impression that i was nervous and not a sociable person, when really I was acting the way I was because of the situation that I was in. There are many factors that lead to someones first impression of another. Someone;s personality, current situation, or the way they happen to present themselves all influences the way someone thinks about another when seeing or meeting them for the first time. Since what they think is based off of these judgments, their first impressions is usually wrong. If all friendships were based on first impressions, there would be a lot less of them in the world. First impressions are more often worst means of judging a person because its not until you get to really know a person, you are better equipped to understand what kind person they truly are, and really know the individual based on real values, rather than their first impression or ""book cover"".",8,8,8,8,9,7,3374,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

It doesnt matter if you get your answer wrong you learn from your mistakes by practicing you get better at it.

534,2880,BB430219DBB4,"In my opinion its not a good idea because in every country in world its role that student have to study 12 yeaer in the then have to go to college. There is some people in the world that they would like to graduate early because they dont like school the only reason they dont like the school is that they wake up early and they cant sleep. If we graduate on the time then we can do something to the country. its good if someone want to take courses because they will learn more things they will have more experiance. In the other countrys the rule in schools are every student have to study 12 years, 7 or 6 book in a book, 12 or 14 test two time in the year the one test is in the half year and the other test is in end of year. In other country after graduate every student of school have to take a big test for college or university in this test the score are start from 1 to 400 hundred the top score is 400 hundred if any one get the first position the president will gave him gift and some money also. The most university are 4 year but only docter have to study 7 years. Our response is that to tell the student who want graduate early that its not good to graduate early because you didnt learn anything you came to schools to learn something not for time pass. there is some student they are coming school for time pass they want to pass their time if you ask them a question they cant answer it for that reason we have to complete 4 year in high then graduate. If a student graduate early then college and university will hard for him because he didnt learn the thing that he need it in the college or univerrsity. Working in school time is not good for student, because he cant learn anything like in the morning he is coming to schools and after schools he is going to work and he is coming from work night and he sleep so when he will study if he didnt study he cant graduate. its rule that 18 year or over 18 have to work but someone is in the school and he is 18 its not to work his family have to support him to study. Its family responsibilty to tell his child to study. when he gradute then he have to work because he dosent have to study too much because collage is easy that school. I hope they change the rule that when student finish thire class and pass ESOL than the are graduate, because the student will take the class that they need it to finish high school and they only focuse on the ESOL and the class that they need if they didnt study the other subjects then why thay make the class they make the class to study and learn something for that reason they have to make a new rule.

535,2881,DA26E5E2C08E,"Many people believe that teenagers should have a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays and during mindnight weekends. In my opinion I say having a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays for teens that works and get out of work late might not be a good idea. Another example can be, you never know when an emergency can happen at your house and or anywhere else and you have no one to pick you up or an emergency hoccurs at your house and you have no one to take you, at least you got your son/daughter to help you out. Lastly during high school is when you get a lot of projects to take home and when you have test the next day and a project due before that can be a hand full and it can stress them out, by letting them do their work and have more time to study, it improves their grades in school and they do better in their classes. I have a lot friends that as soon as they get home they get ready to go to work, and most of them come out at 10 p. m but by the time they get home it can a little more passed 10 p. m depending how far their job is from their house. Many teenagers help to support their family in whatever they can, having a job that can help them support your family is truly a good help. Letting your son work passed 10 p. m is not something you want to get in between due to thier boss changing their schedule sometimes and if hes helping you out by giving you money to pay a bill or to go buy food for the house its worth him/her working a little late. I have friends that work very hard in school and after they home they change, they put on their uniform and they go to work to bring food the house due to his mom not getting payed good enough at her job. Others work to buy themselves their own needs, for exmaple when they have school dances and you need to buy a ticket and your mom has no money, by working you can buy a ticket and attempt to the dance. Another example is prom, prom can be one of the most exiting activities high school has, but it can also be very expensive if you have no money and your trying to look nice and presentable. You never know when an emergency can occur at your house and you have no one to call or help you out. I once had a friend that his mom was pregnant and he had little sibblings that could not drive but him, and as the pain started to get worst he took her the Hospital and thank god everything turned out fine for them but the reaon they didnt call anyone else for help due to the fact they were new in the city and didnt knew anybody and it was passed midnight, so his older son carried her to the car and drove her to the Hospital. You never know when an emergency can happen to you or someone in your family at anytime. Another example was when my dad and I drove to Walmart to buy my mom some medicine because she had a bad fever and a headche and we left the house exactly at 10:30 p. m and when we got back home we gave her medicine and the next day she felt a lot better. During high school is where I have gotten a lot of projects that are hard to make and thier due two days later, not only do I be having projects, I be having homework from all my teachers and test that I need to study. Staying up late to complete your work can most definately help you complete your work or at least do more than what you couldnt had finished if you were to sleep at 10 p. m. Whenever I have a lot in mind like projects, homework, make-up work and test that I need to study really be stressing me a lot until a point where I feel like im being rushed and I cant concetrate right if I have other things in mind that I need to get done. But by having no curfew you can go to bed late, but at least you were calmed about it and you werent rushing into getting it done, when you took your time. Many people can see 10 p. m curfew as something that should be done, but think about the consequences that it can have for example, not being able to work and help your family because can work passed 10 p. m or you never know when something can happen to anybody at anytime and theres noone to help out, or when you need more time to complete your project that you werent able to finished due to curfew.

536,2882,7033DB6BA12E,"I agree because there might be some kids out there who say that they want shorter school time and maybe some dont want that but i think there should be shorter school time. The reason of that is because nowadays theirs youtube and most of the people have phones computers and TVs and so people can go learn stuff from phones,computers,and tv. And theres places that you can learn math too. The reasons of why i think its fair for having shorter school time is because sometimes you learn something that youve learned already and in the other hand its just not fun anymore either i mean for some other kids they think its fun and some not. And also ive seen on twitter that they been hating on the guy who tells us if school is closed or not and people always hope that school is closed because no one is really looking foward to go to school on a monday and my opinion going to school on a monday is the worst and some other people might think the same as well. Some celebreties became famouse for example Eminem who is a rapper he dropped out of highschool and he became famouse for something that he likes to do i would do the same if i didnt what to go to highschool but i wont because i have really good friends and all the years ive known them i just cant leave them like that. I guess it just wont be fair yknow to leave someone youve known for awhile and just become famouse and while there in school working hard. I guess we could all agree that we should have shorter school time because what if your doing something and you dont get to finish your project or something important youll have to wait intill you get out of school and then come back and what if theres traffic and then you get home around 8:30 to 9:00. You wont have that much time to finish your project but if you live close to the school then i cant complain but i agree to this because like how i said we have phones,computers,and TVs and on the internet you could learn anything you want for an example you could learn about 10th grade stuff even though your an 8th grader maybe your interested in that. My point here is that we should have shorter school time because nowadays we could learn by ourselfs and for the preschool kids and kindergarden kids they should stay there a little longer because they are toddlers and they cant learn anything by them selfs but for us we should i have shorter time in school hopefully you could understand. I dont want this to effect anyone but like itll just make all the kids who go to school have more time when they have to do something important instead of coming home late and barely have anytime to finish there project or anything they need to do but thats my point of view.

For example, There was a boy named Generic_Name .Generic_Name was in high school and he was in tenth grade .Generic_Name wanted to be a nurse but his parent didnt want him to be a nurse because they knew that nurse didnt have a lot of money. Generic_Name also wanted to become rich so he could help his family. But Generic_Name dreamed so little for himself. Generic_Name hated when his parent told him that he was not going to be a nurse. When he went to school the next day , he told his friend what his parent told him. Generic_Name friend also knew that being a nurse would not help Generic_Name so he decided to tell him the truth.``Generic_Name maybe your parents are right."", He said.`` Isnt nurse a good job too?,"" Generic_Name asked.``It is , Its just that being a nurse is no good for you and your parents,"" He said.``Why,"" Asked Generic_Name .``Because it doesnt have enough money for you and your parents,"" He said. When Generic_Name went home ,he started thinking maybe his friend was right . He took a lot of time thinking about it. So he decided to be a soldier. At first he didnt want a soldier then he thought about it and he decided to go to soldier school. When he was graduated he went to collage. He worked really hard. When he finished his school,he employed for the soldier work. The first thing they did they buy a new house for him. When he started to work there he didnt have any problems .He felt like his dreams came true. He never had any money problems. And he also had enough money to help his parent. His parent were really proud of their son and happy for him. From there on he didnt have any money problems . In addition The one type of job I would employ would be a soldier because I want to protect people in the country. Once there was a girl named Generic_Name .Generic_Name lived with his father and mother but she didnt have any siblings. Generic_Name Generic_Name s father was a soldier .Generic_Name really loved being a soldier but her parent didnt let her be because in their country girls werent allowed to fight on wars. One day a soldier came to Generic_Name s home and told Generic_Names father that there was war in their town so they needed him. But Generic_Name father couldnt go because he was really sick .And the problem was he only had one child and she was girl. Generic_Names father wanted to go but Generic_Name stopped him because he was very sick and she didnt want her father to die and she also didnt want their town to be destroyed Generic_Name decided to go to fight by her self . When she was on her way to the soldiers she decided to pretend to be a boy because she knew that if she shows her self as a girl the general will send her back to her fathers house .When she got there Generic_Name trained for the war ,she was so ready to fight. The general told them to get ready for the war so that when the enemies comes they start to shoot them first. But the other group planned a really bad way to finish them so when they got there they were all shoot by the enemies except for Generic_Name .She fought all the enemies and they were all died. but when she finished she was so tired so she felt down and slept. when she was asleep the fake hair dropped .When the soldiers came they were so happy but when they saw her they were surprise.``A girl shes a girl,"" one of the soldiers said. When the general came he was so angry that wanted to give the other soldiers permition to kill her but he remembered that she helped them won the the first war so he decided to let her go home and never come back. One day the enemies surrounded the soldiers and they were all attacked. The news was all over the place .The villagers were so afraid because they didnt have any one to protect them .Generic_Name dint want their general to die so she planned something .She went to the enemies secretly .She killed all of their enemies and then she went to their captain . ``Your highness I know the person who wanted to kill you,"" she said. ``He said that he is not afraid of you and he is waiting for you your highness,"" she said. ``Do you you know where that person is now?,"" Asked the captain. ``Yes and he said hes waiting for you ,""She said. ``Take me there,"" Said the captain.``OK ,"" She said. So she took the general out side. But when the general got there he didnt saw any body. ``Where is the person?,"" the general asked.``I am the person,"" Generic_Name said. At first the general laugh and laugh but when they started fighting .The general died and the people didnt have any problems. And from that day on Generic_Name was accepted to be a soldier and everybody respected her . One job that i would like to work to would be a soldier because i want to get a lot of money and I also want to help the citizen just like Generic_Name did. At first Generic_Name thought that being a nurse was the right thing for him but when he stepped to soldier he didnt have any problems about money and his poor family now lives good life because of their child is a soldier. At first the general though that girls can not help on the war but Generic_Name wanted to prove it and she proved that women too are strong enough to be soldiers. Dear Manager I would like to employ for soldier because it is a good way to protect other people and it has a lot of money. Some people think that only men can work on soldier work but if you believe that youre wrong because soldier work is for all of us not only for men. If youre a woman and you want to be a soldier just do it it doesnt matter what type of a person you are.",5,5,5,6,4,5,1820,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

So they can move around and exersice. Sports is a good activity to sign up for because in sports you can sign up for football soccer,baseball,Track All of these activities are great to sign up for even if. You dont have to sign up for these you can sign up for the yearbooks. The year books are great because if more people sign up for the yearbooks the pictures can be done faster. Sports could be a awsome! activity to sign up for because if your in soccer you can go to soccer practices more then 2 times a week. The games can be at least 1 hour and more and you can celebrate when you win a game. Games dont happen offten a week but practicing can be good for you! because you get to run and do laps when your coach tells you to. During games there can be drinks that you can have there is mostly water so that can heal you up and get your energy back. The activities can be thery relaxing and a really good sport to join like if you like to run and exersise just join wich ever sport. The best one is most likely track because in track you can run alot. Football can be hard at most of the time you can go against tall poeple and really strong people the way how you can be like them is just train more and exersise more. If you do that then you will be able to join a higher team with better players in football. during football games the players can be really loud and anoying and tease you wich can be bad and get people mad that has happened alot during football history. during yearbooks if your teaacher tells you, you can get out for class and go to different classes and take pictures in there classroom and post them in the yearbook. Also you can take a camera with you and take some cool pictures there. The yearbooks can be awsome because you can take pictures of fun and funny stuff in a classroom.

540,2886,AB86BAABBF68,"Its a good idea for students to graduate of three years of high school instead of taking for years, i think if they have already passed their classes then they would not have to take elective classes and they might be able to graduate early, but if they need more then seven classes then they might do not be able to graduate and they will have to come during summer to complete their classes that they need to pass. For example if they are still missing some of the work they had to complete at the end of the year they would have to come during summer school or maybe take more classes then what they were allow to be taking. If they need to complete more work they might come during summer break, i think it would be good if you have all your classes that you need in order to graduate since when you come to ninth grade, so at the end of high school you might just come to skool just for maybe two classes and it would be better for you becase you need to pass all your classes either way in order to graduate. and you are assigned with seven SOL and one for english actually you have to be able to pass all the work that youre assigned you must complete all these before you go to the 12th grade, because if you dont complete these assignments before thatnthen you will strugle with these at the end of the senior year of high school, but if you complete all your work that means that you are ready to graduate. For example i am taking four classes that i need to graduate, but i am taking three elective classes because i wanted to learn more, and i did not want to go home early, so i told my counselour i wanted to get three more classes, but it is because i took all the classes i needed to take during the freshman, sophomore and junior year, so now that i am in twelve grade i just have to take just four main classes with are the ones i need in order to graduate. Even tho it would have been a good idea to come in summer because i can learn more, but also would not be a good idea because then i would not be able to graduate on time, or mostly like i would have to come to turn in the work i did not finish during school year, and that would b bad because i want to graduate on time just like the other people that passed all theur classes so i need to put that effort and see or talk with the teacher and ask them what do ni need in order to pass all my classes if i am missing some work i have to turn it in. I want to complete all the work due on time because if i do not turn in the work i am assigned to do then that would affect my grades and that will take me away from graduation, wich i have been waiting for since ninth grade, So i think it is good to complete your work in class, or if you have homework assigned then we must complete it, or like sometimes the teachers put some work in google classroom with dates due, so we must turn the work on time and complete all of it, becase if we do not do it our grades are going to go down and that means we will not be passing the classes that we need to pass and that will not let us walk in the stage We must complete all the work, if we do complete all that is assigned then we will be good and would not have to worry about our grades because the grades will be good too, that is why i say that we need to complete the work and sometimes pay attention to what the teacher is explaining that helps us to understand and make the work easy, but if we do not pay attention, at the end of the day or at the end of the class we will have problems with the understanding of the theme we have studied in class because we did not pay attention in class while the teacher was explaining. One of the examples of not paying attention in class is, what is going to come next like we are going to get very bad grades, so we must do all the work listen while someone is giving instructions because that way we would not have problems with anything and when the test comes up we are going to be prepared to take it and get high grades, because we already studied and if we review our work before we turn it in and make sure everything is good and in order so we would get a good grades. So other reason why we get good grades is if we come to school everyday because if we miss more then ten days we will get suspended and that will mess up your grades because you are abnsent and you will not be able to see or work in the class wich is better because if you do not come to school for couple of weeks then you will not know when you come back to school, you will be lost because you have already missed some of the work we already did while you was not here, so for me i rather coming to shool even though i am sick or something because otherwise i will bring my grades down and one missing day of school will make all my work come down or bring all my classes down because i have been absent and when i come back to school i would not know what to do. It is good to keep your grades up and stay them in the same level because that will help ypu tp graduate, so one of my examples is if i come to school and complete all my work, then i do not have to worry about my grades, but ut is not only about your grades or what you do in class is also about what we get in the test and that will be product of the work and effort we put in class if we did good in our notes or study guides that means we will be great in the test too because it is the same that we learn in class it is all the same what will come in the test, so we need to stay focused and ask for help the teacher if we do not understand what we are doing in class. The teachers are able to help in anything we want, well if it is about the classwork because sometimes we do not understand at all but we can review work and try the best for the next class, we always need to make sure our work is complete before we turn it in because if you have a small mistake that will bring your grades down too and we will not pass our classes and make sure complete everything, in order to graduate.",7,8,6,8,6,6,2298,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

I think its a good idea to change the price of the menu, because some students do not have money for buy lunch, and some people dont eat because dont have money, more when the cafeteria has a good menu. In my opinion its a good idea to know what menu has every day in the cafeteria, all the student want to know what is the menu every day. I think the more import thing is change the time of one hour lunch because most the student want to talk with friends, and some student after eat, they want to go to one class room and talk about classes with the teachers. In my opinion its a good idea to change to a new menu because most of the students dont like the cafeteria food, for example in my school most the time I have bad food because they dont want to change the menu of the cafeteria, and all my friends we talk about the food and they said that most the people they dont like the cafeteria menu. Another importation thing about price of food, most of students dont have money to buy food because the price of the menu is high, its good idea put all the price down and the students that dont have to much money can buy, and its good idea to know what food the cafeteria has every day, for example they has to put a calendar in the fron door of the cafeteria and all the students can see what day has a good food. its a good idea to change the lunch time, for example my school, I have one hour of lunch and after eat I can go anywhere, but most the time I go to my class room to do homework, or talk with my friends and I can learn more because they talk more about classes, games or friends.

544,2890,81946793B89A,"Have you always wondered how your parents accomplished what they have for your future, How famous people like for example singers and world wide companys became so influential to the world. Well Thomas Jefferson once wrote ""Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Now when you think about it, is it beneficial if your always doing something or do you think inactivity also serves a purpose? In my point of view I have to agree on what Thomas Jefferson has stated. You cant accomplish something without working for it and I will be listing examples on why I believe in a strong way that if you keep doing something youll be able to accomplish what you want. My number one example is my parents, Of course its unthinkable that your parents want you to have the best future that you can get but have you ever asked on how they got to this point in life. My parents are heroes for me in a lot of ways but the most important one is how they never stay idle. they work nonstop to make sure my future is bright. They even left their home country so I can have a better life here, They never stayed idle even until this point and theyve gotten pretty far. Second example would be singers, In this day in age believe it or not singers have great influence in this world. Thats because a lot of singers known to man never stopped singing or dancing. They always worked hard to become the number one or wanting to be someone in general that people would look up to. Like Micheal Jackson, Even when he sadly died to this day people still praise him for what he made in the pop music world. Or Snoop Dog and his ability to rap really fast which people gave him the title of rap god. Theres a lot more people that have changed the world because of music but I think they had the highest impact. Now the last example is companys and their founders per say. Car companys, or companys in general had or have someone who started it all, One big example would be Ellon Musk and his Tesla car company. After he made Tesla the best electronic car company to date he decided to keep moving forward with his plan to go all green. His made commuter vehicle and now his focusing on diesel trucks so there can be less pollution in the air and more safety for the drives. His making a lot of impacts in the world because his not just standing around waiting for someone else do it for him. I think Ive said enough and stand by my opinion that if you are doing something you will accomplish what your wanting in the future like how this other people have just like Thomas Jefferson wrote.

545,2891,E6EF69520940,"Most of the times, the students dont get the help they need by the school. The reason for this is because some teachers dont really care about whether the students are learning or not, but about their money. Also, some students get bullied by other students and there is no one who could defend them. This happens in a many schools, such as schools in Mexico, United States, Central America, etc. So, in my opinion, attending classes at home is a great option for the students. Classes online, well known as ""homeschooling"", is a method in which students can do the assignment of their classes at home in their computer. This idea emerged because there is many conflicts that school has to deal with, for example discrimination, and violence and between the students. So, thanks to the advances of technology, the school can provide their services at home. Is a great method, but not as going to the school, sit in your chair and learn. This method has its advantages, but also its disadvantages. One of the advantages attending classes online is that is more comfortable and secure for the students. For example, the rate for shooting will be reduced, and the students will not suffer any discrimination against other students. Another reason are that it is less stressful because the students would more time to complete any work. Also, it helps the students to better subject. For example, students can watch videos about any specific subject, observe the procedures, and replay them if they are confused. Also parents can supervise their children and help them if they need, and they would not have to worry about attendances. Classes online are a great benefit for students but they their disadvantages as well. For example there will be no jobs for teachers who really want to teach, share experiences to their students, and help them to improve in their lives. Another example is that students would not communicate with other students and would not know the importance of Team Work. Also, they would not have an experience by doing activities (such as playing sports, instruments, going to filmstrips, etc,) which help them to develop useful skills. Another disadvantage is that schools would not have alternate classes that helps them to chose the career they want to. For example construction, cosmetics, arts, music, engineering, technology, etc. In conclusion, attending classes online is a great method, but not as much as going to the school. The school is always going to be a learning center. If the school applies more fair rules, the students would feel more safety and gain a lot of confidence. Also, the school has to have better teachers who really want to help their students and not teachers that only care about their job. Anyways, the school helps us to get right path for our lives, so without it, we would not the education we need to improve in our lives and in the world.

First of all, if you want to change any first impression, you have to will it. You need to have a vision of how you want to change it. Most people try to change their first impression, but the thing is they dont have a vision. Without a vision you are going nowhere, you most have a vision. Lots of people give up but I know you can do it, because failure is not an option. Always remember will is power. Second of all, willing something is just the first part to change our first impression. The hard work is probably the most complicated, becasue is where you gonna find some challenges. Challenges are part of life, so dont see them as impossibles, but see them as oportunities. You have to work hard to reach your goal, no matter what. Keep this in mind life is not fair, so you better keep doing and dont look back of what have you done. Always have a clear vision og what you do. Finally, this is probably the most importamt part, confidence. Confidence plays a big roll to change our fisrt impresion. If your not a cofident person, it migth be hard for you to change but not impossible. You can take classes to gain cofidence like me which is helpful. Im not cofident person but took the JROTC class which has help me to be more confident amd not olny that, I have learned to be a leardership too. If I can do it, that mean you can. Dont let anything to stop you. Inconclusion, think about your future is very important. Changeing your fist impression is a good start. You never know if that will affect your future.

547,2893,92CD1BD0C18F,"A good attitude is one of the most important things in life, because when you talking or do something with the best attitude you can see how everything is going great, and people feels good and comfortable with you. In the same time, it can open a lot of doors for you, and it can be a good opportunity for be a successful. On the other hand, people believe that have a good attitude all the time is not a good idea, because some people will make use you, but most of the people who think like that dont have a success life; most of that people in the future feel depressing, feels like they dont do nothing with you life, they are not sucessful, and is something that every person needs thing about, you need prove that you can do it, that you can be a professional, and that you are more than people thing of you, because you need show people that is nothing imposible in life, that all your goals and dreams can makes real. For example, a person work in a restaurant and you have a good attitude with the customers, you make them feel like in home, not waiting too long for their drinks and food, you will show them that you really happy for have them in there; in the other side, a person who works in the restaurant, dont smile to the customer, make they feel uncomfortable, and dont care about their drinks and food they dont going back to the restaurant or dont choice you for be their waitress, because you dont have a good attitude with your customers. Also, make yourself a successful person, a person who the people want to talk, a person who a company want to you for work there, a person who do all ther goals and dreams, and a person who love himself, because you got love yourself, respect yourself, and try your best every single day, that is really impotant in your life. The attitude make you go for the best or wrong way, the best give you the best opportunity for a successful person; however, the bad give you the the work in where you do feel good, and where the best part of your day is when you go to the bathroom and use you phone for a couple minutes, when you got to life for check to check, that is the life of people who think the attitude is no the key of success, everyone dont reserve that, they reserve be happy, and have a good life with the people they love. Is the same way in shool, talking about teacher and students, ""respect if you want respect back"", most of the students always have attitute with their teacher, they never respect them, but they want respect, a good attitude in school is the best thing we can do, because the teacher will help you more if they see you respect and really want to work, you are the person who need good grades, if you have a good attitude you will se the process in your life, in your classes, and your home. Also, in home, their parents need show and teach their kids that the attitude is the key of life, that they need have a good attitude if they want to be a good person in the future, that they want to be a professional, and be better person everyday, they will think on that, they will ask themselves why their parents try teach them that the attitude is important, and they will tray to have a good attitude for be a successul person. In conclusion, the attitude is the key that will open all the doors you want, thats no matter what problems you have, when you do something you need doing with the best of you attitude, all is going to be perfect when you got a good attitute with people and with yourself. Try and see how your life is going for a straight way.

548,2894,4F35BA561593,"Some people ask if it is better to work with a group or alone? Everyone has different opinions about the benefits of working in a group or working alone, some people prefer working alone and others prefer working in groups. I believe that the best way for the people to improve is by working in groups because they learn more and understand better. First, working in groups help the people to improve in school or at work because they learn new things. For example, listening other ideas and points of view from their partners. One day my English teacher make groups of four in class and gave each group a piece of paper, then he put some questions in his board and told us that we need it to answer them as a group, when we finish the teacher told us that we were going to discuss it, then when each group discuss their answers with the class we all realized that each group had different opinions, ideas, and points of view. Each group learn something new from each other. ""Everyday we all learn new things in life"". Second, working in groups help the people improve because they will understand better. For example, asking their partners if they have a question or didnt understand really well. My history teacher gave the class an assignment that we need it to completed by the end of the class, when the teacher gave the instructions i didnt understand her really well, then i ask one of my partners if he could explained to me again in order for me to understand it, be able to give my opinions and help my group. ""We could do more if we all help each others"". Many people believe that is better to work alone because they will concentrate more. For example, they will not get distracted with anyone and will finish the work faster. A friend of mine has always work alone because she said that when the people is working in groups they tend to start talking, distract others, dont do their work and by the end of the hour only got a couple of questions done. However, this argument is meaningless because if they dont understand really well, then they would not have a partner who could explained to them what they are doing. For example, not finish their work because they got stuck in a part. Not having someone to discuss the work with could be hard sometimes. In conclusion, theres a lot of benefits when working with a group. Some of the others benefits that working in groups has are; making new friends, having the opportunity to learn more about your partner, and learn more about yourself. Having to work with someone is a good idea because you dont have a lot of pressure about having to finish the work on time or not having idea what to do. Even though some people say the opposite, i believe that working in groups is better than working alone. ""Sometimes you will need a little help from others in order for you to improve"".

For example, my girlfriend who has very often panic attacks, dislikes attending her current school. She was a new transfer student to the school and was also new to the school itself. She found it hard to not have anybody to go to and vent during the school day which causes her to stress and have anxiety. Moreover, she gets very often panic attacks during the day which makes her not want to come to school more often. She finds it easier and safer to stay at home. When ever were on the phone over face time, shes always doing her class work that she takes home to complete. Shes a hardworking student and always does her work but because of the environment shes in, it limits her on what she is capable of. Not only that it would help students feel secure, but for the students who are sick for the day and cannot attend school, wouldnt have to miss out on important information or work. For example; there are days where I just feel weak and tired but I wouldnt want to miss a review day for a major test the next class. If there was online school, I would be able to connect with my teacher and the classes from home where I feel comfortable. Also, my mom wouldnt have to worry that im failing my classes because im not showing up to them. I believe that other students would agree with me on this argument because almost everyone I know, wishes they could attend school from home. Moreover, adults might not have knowledge of this, but let me tell you; there is a lot of drama and rumors in every high school. No matter where it is, the policies it has, the advances of the students, there is drama. And drama is one major factor on why students wishes to attend school at home. Just Imagine the advances of our present civilization if there was no drama at school, and no have you heard this or have you heard that. Drama and rumors are big time distractions to daily school work and it peaks the interest of every student. By enabling online school, students dedicated to become scholars are able to take this distraction out of their equation. They can attend school without dealing with the big mouths talking up and down and all around the school. Overall, distance learning has a very good impact on the students. Students feel safer at home, and when they are sick or cannot attend school for they day, they wouldnt have to miss out on important information or work. Online school would be very beneficial for everyone.",8,9,9,9,8,9,3073,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
550,2896,B4CF5269C465,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. Some students take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. It would be a bad idea as students need more preparation before go to college, because students need advanced classes, time to know what they want and get more opportunities that help them in college. Some Students dont be prepared go to college when they graduated. because some people know college is more difficult than schools. for example: My sister graduate early to high school and go to college, when she take the test she dont know the answers; because ask to her about classes that she never see in high school, she lost the test and she had to pay for take that classes before to start with her profession. Is it not a good idea to graduated early as students can get all credit in high school and star to take more advanced classes that they need to college. Some students take one year more in high school to take advanced classes. For example: my best friend dont have the money to pay college and they want to get a scholar ship in high school, he has all the credits and sols that he need to graduate, but he take another year; because he want to take advanced classes like physics or difficult classes that he need in college, and is it opportunity to learned classes that you need in college free. but if a students have just three years to graduated when they go to college they dont know nothing classes that they really need. It would be a bad idea to allow students to graduated in three years as they dont be prepared to the college. students need to experiment elective classes and find what they want because some students when graduated dont know what they want to do after graduated. some people said is better go to college one year early and be professional early however a good professional is not who get all diplomas early is who have the more experience and know more about that. In conclusion, allow students to graduated early is a bad idea. students need prepared more before go to the college and get time to take the opportunities to take advances classes or get scholar ships that they really need in college. A good student is no who finish their high school early; is who know and learned more that they need.",7,7,7,6,6,6,2436,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

554,2900,BBE9DDA6E3BD,"When I was in the fifth grader I went to the camp over summer the first day they made us do a project with a group to earn the title of the best group. The benefits of working in the group or working alone. Working in the group is more beneficial rather than working alone to work in the group is fun, makes me be more responsible and it is also the easier and creative way of finding solutions for the problem. First of all, working in the group is fun. For example, I have a friend who didnt like to work with anyone or even talk in his classroom,,, one day his teacher put him with group of students after working with them he finally made a new friends and the work that teacher was giving them was much more enjoyable with mates. For that reason I think this is a great way of learning, communicating and building friendship with people around us. Also group work makes us more responsible. I have friend his name is Generic_Name and I want to tell you something about him he is the most irresponsible student I have ever seen, but when it comes to a group work he is getting his job always done because he doesnt want his group lose the competition or simply fail the project. This made my vision clear that working with others makes people more responsible. Some say working with a group distracts them from the task, but I will disagree with them because I believe, that working in the group helps you find the creative way of solving the problems. In my computer science class we usually work with groups so there is this guy that thinks he knows more than some of us and for that reason he didnt work with us, so we solved the problem the way that no one in our class has solved the problem this way and the teacher gave us extra points for being the creative group of the class, and the smart guy that I mentioned before couldnt solve that problem. This is way I dont like to underestimate my teammates or classmates I know that together we can be smarter, faster, and even If the problem seems unsolvable together we can do it. In conclusion, working with a group is enjoyable, make you fulfill your obligations, and makes it easy for students to solve any kind of tasks. Finally, students are not going to be stressed about the problem and will complete the task with higher quality.",8,8,7,8,8,8,2533,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
555,2901,219A0A3B6B5D,"First each person decide what they want sometimes people have to make hard decision about any situation in their life. Also students have to decide what career should they take. Each person has the right to make their own decision about anything they propuse. Second for example if a guy is in a relationship and he has to decide if he is going to stay forever with hes girlfriend. He has to decide but probably there will be opinions or probably he will need their parents help but the decision is hes. Also hes girlfriend have to make that decision too if she wants to marry him. However if both of them decide to marry each other that and agreement. They have define their decision. Third for example some students started to choose their career early so they can have time to decide what career they want to choose. Some student are cumplicated for choose their career or what they want to be. Sometimes its hard for some students to choose a career sometimes students need help from their teachers. However the students can accept the teachers helped or opinions but the decison is the students. Fourth for example every person has the right to decide what they want in their life. However young person sometimes they take wrong decision in their life. Sometimes Young people does not know what they want in that situation the parents has to help them to make the right decision in life. Although everybody has the right to decide what they want in life but some do not know therefore they required helped.

556,2902,1D47271C213D,"The students must be self- confident in order to succeed. I agree that hard work helps to build self-esteems because students must have faith in their own abilities, they have to learn from their mistakes, and be proud of them achievements. Thats why students can not be conform with insufficient work just to be admired by teachers or parents. Also, to able to be successful always needs high standards. Even though, parents and teachers decide to praise the students by giving them gifts or other things. It can motivate the students but there is some days were people are not in a good mood and forget to praised the students. Thats how students cant continue with the same motivation and loose confidence. For example, my Probability Statistics math class she used to gave us candy every single day so we never try to do our classwork, everybody failed her class. Several students make mistakes while they are trying to accomplishing something and they give up when they dont have an easy solution. In reality that is when they are used to be treated with extreme indulgence. Of course, it doesnt matter how many mistake they make; it matters to continue believing in them self. Eventually, my friend Generic_Name came from Generic_City, she used to go to Susbury University it was difficult for her to learn English she also failed three classes. But she did not care how many times she failed. She believe in herself and she achieved her goal now she is an ESL teacher. How does people becomes doctors or professionals? some people dont have their parents alive or they are far away from each other so they dont have nobody to praised them. From my opinion, they should be proud of them self. All the effort, dedication, passion for the school and they dont need somebody to award them to be trust. But also, its not easy for the students to succeed in this world unless they want to work for it. Everybody can notice when they gain something beneficial for their life and be satisfied with them great effort. From my own experience, my biology teacher it was very strict that she screamed at my face the first day of the semester but I showed her that Im better what she thought I was. So I passed her class with an average of 80 and I also passed the SOL. Finally, when the students are comfortable from what they already accomplished, its when they have a great opportunity to build them self-esteems. They do not need to be pushed with emotional things to able to be confident, If they get emotional later on, they wouldnt be able to continue without being praised. Some people do not survive when they dont get to achieved, then they complain on someone who dont give presents. Self-esteems always comes from achievements never comes from praising.

557,2903,72C0B0B91BFC,"There are so many things that can make good deed too someone with a good attitude even you can make yourself happy, But sometimes its hard to keep a good attitude while its a difficult time. I myself have witnessed someone with a good attitude it was my good old friend he was having a good attitude all day,But than someone in his family passed away he was really sad about it. Than his attitude was going bad I tired to make his day get better to go and get ice cream but than he was up for it so I was in a good attitude so was he so we were happy, But than his mom got really sick and the doctors said that she might not make it and than he shaded tears and than his day was just going horrible. So much was going on with his family like his mom is so sick she can barley move she was taken to the hospital because she had a high fever of 103. The day they took her to the hospital has got a heart attack at the night she was there and when she was there for a few days and than they brought her back home and that same night she got a heart attack again and my friends dad just said she cant leave the hospital or she might die if we take her back a few weeks passed and his mom recovered and now they are a happy family. I have witnessed my family member have a good attitude even during a difficult time. One of my family members were going though depression but no one else knew because everyday he always looked happy there was always a smile on his face when someone saw him there was not a time he looked upset or sad but just happy all the time. No one knew what he was going through they didnt know he was getting bullied,failing his classes and last of all no friends he thought he had no one and he kept telling himself he was alone. Everyone thought he was mad at something little like him not getting a toy or something because he was just a 10yr boy the rest of the family thought he was just a regular little kid running around all over the place laughing at everything and even cry at little stuff, but no he did nun of that all he did was just stay in his room lights turned off and the door was shut and locked. But than one day he forgot to lock his room and than I walked in and he was just crying and kept saying ""I got nobody I got nobody"" and than i made him feel better and then we put him in counseling for a few months and he started getting better and better while time went on. When you have a good attitude it can make your day be good and youll be positive with everything. Even in a bad times like for example if a family member or a friend is sick you can make there day by getting them there favorite food or snack that can get them in a good attitude with you because they may be a little grumpy while there sick. While your in a good attitude youll feel like you accomplish something for today and while other people will try to take you down you mind and your feeling will be strong and you wont be able to be in a bad attitude. Most people would want to be be in a good attitude but others are the world should just be happy and not always mad at something. I wish everyone in the world can be happy and something they did and not be mad at everything like sometimes when you play sports when you lose its a little upsetting at first but than you lose your attitude get stronger and you start being your self way more. I witnessed another of my friends trying to keep a good attitude his attitude was getting stronger and better because he played a lot of soccer but than his dad kept taking it to seriously. My friend was so tired that he wanted to take a break but his dad didnt let him he kept telling him get up lets go play everyday and on weekend his dad woke him up at 5 in the morning to go play soccer. Than on Monday when he got back to school he started getting eye bags under his eyes and than he was tired of it and went o his dad and i said Im tired of soccer and i give up. His dad looked so shocked and upset that he left him speechless and than he said fine when you grow up you are not going to become a famous soccer player. My friend still played soccer but he only played when he wanted to and he still was really good at soccer that I bet you he is better than me. One time my friend and I were in a good attitude right we were playing at the park and than my friend jumped off the slid and than he broke his arm is was so nasty His bone was popping out he was crying and yelling and Ididnt know what to do and i called his partents they came so fast and than they took him to the hospetil and I was sad because I felt like it was all my fault and than his partents cheered me up and they said its not yout fault its okay its just a common mistake and a few weeks later his arm got better his arm was in a case so he was good and I was the first one that sighned it so i was happy about that and than we were both happy we got ice cream and we had a sleepover and the rest of the day was good.",4,5,6,6,5,5,1489,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 4"

559,2905,E25FE9E05F36,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. There is a lot of benefits of having a positive attitude which are health or physical improvements, how to solve a problem, and the power that exists inside you. The benefits of optimism extend beyond stress relief better health, more rewarding relationships and enhanced productivity. People with a positive outlook tend to experience are reduced incidence of depression, lower stress levels and are better able to cope with stress causing events, an incresed life span and overall better health. People with a positive outlook on life are also more likely to live healthier lifestyle, and to smoke cigarattes less and drink less alcohol. Attitude is the way taht we behave and we react to the daily activities, consequently a positive attitude may influence our life and it aspects in a deep way such as how we think, socialize, and even how our health is. All these aspects might be affected by a positive attitude. Actually it is proved that successful people have been influenced by the way they see the circumtances in their life. In other words, successful people see those circumtances with a positive attitude and they see those circumtances as a challange to beat and not like a punishment to suffer. Therefore, these people will be more likely to fight and have success in their life, rather than the ones who see their life as a punishment. Positive attitude might be the key to all the people who want to fulfill their dreams. If everyone would apply these concepts in their lives, they would become happier because they will see that everything including their life, situations, and problems, is under their own control. Even though there are some people who wonder how to get a good positive attitude, is not simple to get it. Almost every single person that has has a positive attitude is because tehy have had a motivation or a feeling that supports their fight to reach their goal or achievement. When you have a positive attitude, you feel that there is a power inside of you that motivates you to do something or to get involved with something. These people are most commons to have best attitudes of this world. Having a positive attitude can lead you to the lighter, braver and stronger way to stand against negative attitude.

The first step that I say that nobody choose our own character is because when we are sad nobody can change our attitude or own character somebody can try to help us but they dont gonna change our attitude because when we are sad sometimes we are angry, and our character is so bad that we dont want to do anything we just want to be alone or we just need to take a brake because maybe we are stress. My mom teach my how to behavior and that I have to respect the older peoples but she dont choose how my character it gonna be In other words some peoples make us strong like my mom she teach me how to be strong too, and some peoples teach you that how to be strong but they dont choose how we gonna be how we gonna act, they cant teach us or change us our character we are the only person who decided If we need to change our character, however sometimes we need to change our character and that is gonna help us in the school in the house and in the life, and a person who is very respectful nice and have a good character is very important because what happened if you are angry have a bad character in the work nobody is gonna like to work with you the same happened in the school, if we have a bad character nobody is want to work with us that why sometimes is very important to change our character The last reason but not the less important is without a doubt sometimes is important to changes our character like for example, my English teacher have some students that they dont care about the class, and she need to change her character in the class so that way the students stop talking and distracting the class, and when she change is character they stop to talk because she put angry and rude, but however she never change her character she always are happy she only change the character when the students are talking or playing in the class but they dont change the teacher character she change her own character Nobody can change our character we decides if we change or not, sometimes it is important to make some changes to be a better person, and to help our self or to help other people, a person with a good attitude and with a good character always is gonna be good work with them we need to know when we need to change, and why we need to change and that is gonna help us for the life and for everything and always it is important to smile.",7,6,7,7,5,5,1279,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

We have many benefit from to being able to attend classes from home for example, we have more time for sleep and have more energy for study, also the students has more dedication, the students has more concentration for study in home because, nobody distract to the student, the students have more time for make other things like work or others pastime Many student dont like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I dont think so because we have help of all teachers. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they dont pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life. Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you. For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. Maybe This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable. Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience. In my conclusion I support and for me is a good idea the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because is a new experience and i like it the idea and is more comfortable stay in home is more peace, more concentration, is more time for study and more important is learned more things, new thing for the future because the place is not important you can study in others places but the important is study more and more.

562,2908,1D75D76AC202,"Dear Principal, I was thinking about the policies you were offering about the cell phones allowed in school and I would suggest to choose policy 2 because students arent going to follow what the first policy says. Also because students have no reason to be texting in class if other students they are texting are in class too, students shouldnt be allowed to have phones in school because they would be distracting the rest of the class when their phone goes off in class. If students can have phones in school its a sure fact that theyre going to be using them in class. With Policy 2 the school can take the phones away at the beginning of the school day to be sure they arent using the phone during class. Also with Policy 2 the students arent able to be communicating just in case they have a test. If the phones are taken away they will reduce the chances of the students cheating on tests. I also pick Policy 2 because students are going to be distracting the class if someone sent them a message and the phone goes of in class in the middle of a lesson. No one likes to be distracted while they are learning, or at least i know i dont. Thats why there shouldnt be phones in schools. With phones the grades of the students will go down because, they arent paying attention. So i think you should pick Policy 2 So there are less distractions. Also so they arent cheating in tests.

564,2910,13450D581EC9,"I am agree with the Waldo Emersons prompt. He wrote that "" to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" ""Never give up."" This word conveys our intensify about our thought. It makes us courageous. Life is not a bed of rose, life is struggle. Every single person has their life struggle. Nobody is a perfect at they look. A perfect man is he who win the struggle. A successful man, he not get success in a second. He had lot of struggle in his life,but he dont stop for his goal. After long time keep trying made him successful. He adjust the struggle and keep go through the struggle and win the struggle which is make him success. For example a soccer player has his goal to make a score so that they can win. But for making a goal he has to cross the against team then he will success to make a goal. You failed !. You are done your life today. We couldnt expect from you this. You fool !. You looser. Now you go home and get sleep thats all you can do. Should I listen them and do what they want or give up my life? NO!.I am failed, i am looser but it dosent mean that i cant win anymore. Dont lose hope. You have hand,you have brain,you have leg use those one day win come to you then you can show them that you did. you made it. For example,you are not good in Math but its dosent mean that you are bad in Social Science. Show your talent. You cant able to solving the Math equation but you have talent to make Social Science rules. Time is valuable more than everything. A good minded people use their proper time. If you use time and you failed in your success then dont lose hope,dont stop, dont blame on time and yourself. Time can give you more opportunity to use it and make yourself successful. You just have to keep try. But if you being lazy you just waste your time and you got looser reward from the time. Always remember that time never gonna come back. For example, If you dont do your homework the teacher not gonna give you a grade. You gonna fail in this subject. You just waste your time. But if you do the homework but is incorrect. The teacher can give you one more time to fix the correction though its incorrect. An Inspiration can make your goal. If you look or read about successful person how they became successful in their life you also can inspire to do what they did. An inspiration can bring you encourage. Make you sense what you want to do and what should you do for your future. There are different people has their different choices. From the successful people you can organize your life. For example, there was a story about Robert Bruce and a Spider. One day Robert Bruce was laying in the cave and saw a spider was trying to climb the wall but its failed seven times to reach the wall of top. After seven times keep trying makes its successful. The spider reached the top of the wall. This event make Robert Bruce inspire himself. Everything has their opposition. If you wanna be a good man you have to know what is bad things. The same way if you want to win you have to know what is lose. Fail is common afire in human being. If you dont fail its mean you dosent even try. Fail is a part of our life. But dont get depressed yourself by depression. You fail but you have more option to start it from the beginning again. Before you stop try just think should i try one more time. Maybe this time you can become a winner. Just one more think can bring your success. For example, You digging a soil for the gold. You dig almost come to the gold but this time you give up and stop digging the soil. If he dig the soil one more time he can see the gold which one he want. So always think one more time before you quick. An aim can make our decision properly. An aim less man cant success in his life. A right decision depend on your future. First make a routine for your work. If you want to success in your goal you have to follow your routine. In a student life its hard to follow the rules. But if you try you can do it. In student life student should give full attention to their lesson. homework should be done before going school or college. if you continuously follow the rules it will be easier for you to success your life. Dont be lazy. Lazy is a weak point in our life. From the laziness your life never gonna successful. So always do hard work until you done in your work. some people we have in our society they has dream but they dont wanna work. If you dont work how can you full fill in their life. Always keep try to get your dream. We have time we have life just try as much as you can. Some people in our society some times they messed up with your dream or your work. They dont wanna let you to do your work. This typ of people are very harmful to our life. They always bothering you cant lets you doing work. That time we should ignore them. Dont say anything with them. One day they will leave you automacilly. For example, if any person can bother you every day and if you ignoring him one day he will not interest with you and leave you. The success of life bring you happiness. You will feel proud yourself. If you show them that you did it then they will fell ashamed because they thought wrong think about you. So never be lazy. Always do hard work,keep try and think about it what should you do or not. End of the moment it will be Happy Ending for you because you erase the wrong think the people think about you.",7,7,6,6,6,6,265,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
565,2911,DCCA609D1212,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Success isnt around the corner. Youll have to work as hard as you can until you reached your limits. Always trying new things will make you grow."" Life can be great, if you know how to make the best out of it. Although, it may seem that trying is hard and its a waste of time, it is actually true that trying can make you achieve your goals. Trying my hardest showed me who I really am. I accomplished some of my goals, but I always try to be inspired. This helped me get through my problems. None of my goals have been easy, theyre hard, but that doesnt stop me. My plan is to be successful in life and not to be a failure. Sometimes I loose and sometimes I win. I used to be 275 pounds, I wasnt happy with the way I looked. I also experience random pain in my heart. My body was telling me to start loosing weight. I really wanted to go and loose all of my weight, but my lazy side said to just sit in the couch and play video games all day. I had to get my life together and started going to the gym, the following day. Day by day, I started to feel something different. I felt more energetic and strong. I ate healthy and those heart pains were gone. My parents were always there for me to encourage me. I also wanted to be an example to my little brother that anything is possible, as long as you try. I lost 58 pounds to be exact. I feel lighter than ever. I went beyond my limits to accomplish my goal. All hard work always rewards you as it did for me. My reward was having cheat days. I always love cheat days because you can forget about your diet for a day and eat whatever you want. Cheat days are the best to have, but not all the time. You can loose track and fall. Accomplishments are hard to achieve, but its a lot of fun to do them. They can make you a better person and makes your life so much easier. As long as you try your best, you can do anything. My grandpa told me that trying is your best buddy. It can make you push yourself and it can take you places youve never seen in your life.

566,2912,F57B95D17755,No not good for older and younger students to be in a program. But sometimes older kids become mean and dont care about the younger just care themself to have fun. Its not normal for that to happen and it will feel weird harder stuff for the younger ones dont know and the older kids think its too easy. Theres so much reasons that it shouldnt happen doesnnt feel right. If it was like in the summer for an activity that would be great because you learn about how the older and younger kids are. The younger kids will want to do childess stuff and the older ones want to just be on there phones and just talk. Sometimes the older ones need to teach the younger ones to be more grown up so they learn about the older ones. The teachers mostly will try to tell the older ones to help the younger ones to be grown up. So usually they shouldnt create schools like that it will feel completly different because there will be different stuff then real schools with older and older kids and younger and younger kids. The younger ones could sometimes scream and run or goof around a lot and the older ones sometimes will feel annoyed by them. So lots times I feel like the older ones will feel unconfortable from the little ones. When you grow older you learn what you do now and not like when you were younger. Most the time you usually want to be friends with people your age not too much of a different age. Sometimes it can happen to be friends with someone older or younger but most times your age. Always try to be yourself and not change your additude. Sometimes the older kids will need to try make the little kids happy by talking with them and have fun with them. But not for to long you should because it will get boring doing it for a long time. When u finshis they will sometimes try bothering you because they liked what you did but just leave them alone after. These are examples why sometimes you should or shouldnt allow those schools with older and younger students. After when you grow older you the one teaching the new kids to be grown up. Try remeber the times you were little and what the older kids did to you do that with others. But there could be lots of times younger ones a different and you were that way 8 years ago. Help everyone be a grown up kid and still think not too much they should add schools with older and younger kids.,5,5,5,6,6,7,3650,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

568,2914,3B93AE972238,In this school year I may be doing Homework club because I want it to get all of my homework done at school and to turn it in on time. Homework club is a go thing that I chose because their are teachers their to help you to get your homework done. Another go thing in homework club is that if you have trouble with your homework the teachers could help you with it. kids will love if the school time never changed so they could get home on time and even the bus driver and the teachers to. Well I think that the kids wont like it because lots of kids will be coming home late in night will the bus driver and the teachers if they live far from school. The after school stuff will be late into the night for the kids who will be staying and some of the teachers to and the bus driver to if the schools add one and a half hour to school each day. Kids will hate it if the school adds another one and half hour to school each day so some kids hope that they do not started school at 8:00 oclock in the morning and they finished school at 5:18. Some kids will kind of love the idea that the school is adding one and half hour because some kids love school that they just dont want to go home and do their homework because you have to take your baby brother. Some kids will love to stay after school and the stuff they do and lots of kids will problem stay at homework club to get all their homework done for all their classes so they do not get a bad grade if they did not do their homework. Some kids will like to come home at 6:50 or 7:00 oclock because they could just eat their food and they did all of their homework and they could just watch T.V. Some kids will love the idea to add one and a half hour to school each day and some of the kids will hate the idea.

569,2915,BF267B42A2A4,"The humanity now in days had been not so good lately, there is many different opinions on how you should do things in life or how you should act. It is well informed that people can be complicated but nobody will said the life will be easy all the time. I think people should start making their own decision because, they can learn about life, have a better understanding on how life works and how to value their-self and be efficient person on their own. However, there is a big chance that people can tell you how you really should live your life, you have to experienced it in persons there will be a day when you are going to fall or something can happen you are not aware on how life can be so hard and difficult in times. Also mistakes are allow nobody is perfect life will surprise you anytime without you notice it you got to be ready to face it not matter how easy or hard it could be. When you make your owns decision you will be capable of making the right decision for yourself. Meanwhile, it is hard to understand life sometimes but is part of our daily life and you have to understand how it really works so the way you do not stress out for a simple thing, life gives you challenges that only you as the only responsible of yourself have to face it and all will depends how you take things it will be a result of it. As we grow life will make us stronger or weak it all depends but best choice of making the right thing is that you should be aware that anything can happen without given you a hint it will hit you on the right time or not on the best time you wanted it. Anything that will hurt you will make you strong and thats how you know that your are living life. Lastly, people might not notice it but if we do not love ourselves nobody will do it, people do have to depend on some else to be happy its all about you. In addition anything you do will not make others happy you have to learn to do everything on your own because that more efficient you are the more good things in life you will make. Be your own and value every single thing that is around, but remember nothing is easy life can surprise you anytime. In conclusion, people should start making their own decisions to be aware of what life really is if your learned and have a better understanding about life in a daily routine anything that will happen will not surprise you. Loving yourself will make you love others. Hopefully people will take a note that life is all about you and not others each person has a different thoughts and ways of seen life.

570,2916,15968BD9B40A,"Some schools have programs where younger students can work with older students. For example, At my school theres homework club right after school. Teachers of all sort of subjects come to the libary and help out with your questions. The teachers also let you communicate with any grade level students. So I think that students of all ages should interact with each other. So I think it can help younger students understand if they cant capture the meaning or they need an older student to clarify for them. Because younger students look up to the older students. Meaning that when there the oldest in the school or one of the oldest, they can help out kids/students who need help and use the same strategy that the older student tought them when they were younger. So then, the younger students would always wanna go to the programs that the older students go to for some help. It benefits for the older students because, For example, If one of the students wanted to become a teacher and is really shy, Then they can work on their communication skills on the younger students and become more secure about them selves and become a teacher. For example, When they were teaching they young ones, they could use that exact same stragety when they were ""teaching"" when they were young. It defenitly can help both because, It can help with communitcation skills and meet new people youve never meet i your life, And then later on in the future youll become really good friends with them. This can help out a lot not only one way but a lot, Because if youre the young one then you still have a long way to go. And if youre the older one then if you thought you can pursue your teaching carrear then you still have a chance to be a teacher in life. In conclusion, My essay was yes. Why? Because some younger students parents didnt go to school, or finished school. So they have no one to ask for help. But this isnt only for homework club, this can be for any activty or program theres in the school. It can be sports,cooking, teaching, ect. For example, If you played a sport and you were the youngest, you can ask the oldest for help. Like how can i improve my skills, or how can i improve my passes, ect.

For example a high schooler that takes classes online that wants to be a history teacher they can struggle a lot because a video cant give you enough information, for you to know the story. a video only summarize the story comapring to when youre in class you can ask questions and also have more information from your teacher. Having a teacher explalining you everything and working with other students can help your grade and also your GPA for you to attened to good collages and be able to have a lot of advantages. Students will have more benefits and advantages of learning the materials, if they atten to school. students will also have good grades and apportunities for them to get a scholarship and have a higher GPA that would help them attened the collage they want to go to.

580,2926,ACA1A45EE438,"I strongly disagree with extending the school days. Longer school days can have a great impact on students. It also makes class hours long. Most students likes to have short classes. Longer school days can make students, exhausted, have less free time, and hate school. Longer school days will not make students happy. Longer school days can make students exhausted. Longer school day causes the classes to be longer. Which most students get tired of being in the same class for a long time. Students get tired of doing a lot of work in class which make them want to do less work. Students will be exhausted which will make them not go outside. By extending school days students will not have free time. Most students like to spend time with their family and friends. However, longer school days can take that privilege away. Longer school days can take away students free time. Most of the year it can get dark outside early, and students wont be able to go outside after they come from school. Since students wont have enough free time to go outside they will hate going to school. Students will hate going to school when there is longer school days. Because students like to have less class time. Also students would want to do less work. Students wouldnt want to be in their least favorite class for a long time. If the school hours get longer students would not want to come to school. Also some students would skip the classes they didnt like. By adding hours to the school days students will be, tired, they wont be able to have free time, and they will not want to be at school. Students will hate school if the hours get longer. Students will not enjoy school. Also classes would have a lot of work in one day which would make them not want to come to school. In conclusion there should not be one and a half hour added to school days. ",8,6,6,8,8,8,2319,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
581,2927,AFD325C9347D,"What would happen if school offer the program to student that qualify for the program that only take three year of high school instead of the four years. Here are some examples, and reason why is a good idea for school to offer this types of programs. Reason number one is that students that had As and Bs in the past years like middle school and the beginning of high school maybe qualify for the three year insted of the four year of high shool, because they are so intelligen that they not need the four years of high school. Reason number two is that if they graduate from high school they may like to apply for a community service for there college aplication. Reason number three is that some student dont have the money to pay for college so they may need a year to save some money to pay for college, or some student may not like college so they are only going to finish high school, and they are going straight to work, and the more experience you learnd form a jod the better it is so is a good idea to begin at a younger age. So i think that the program that school offer to studen for them to take the opportunity to graduate early from high school is a good idea beacuse it will help them alot in there life.",8,6,6,6,6,6,2369,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
582,2928,EA42A6028804,"People argue whether or not its a good idea for students to study or identify a carrier of their choice when entering high school. I agree that students should commit to a career of choice when entering high school because theyll be ahead in life than many other students who dont get the opportunity to chose a career they want to learn in high school and studying their choice of career at a younger age would have them college ready. Learning a specific carrier at the time when entering high school is very beneficial to students because it would have students who do chose to learn a carrier would have them very much ahead of students who their high schools dont even offer the opportunitie to learn a carrier during their years of high school. Learning and mastering a career of choice is something that students should take for granted because once mastered it can lead u to many opportunities while your in high school or have graduated. These opportunities can lead you to Paid internship programs, college scholarships, and even a Job right after high school. Students who get to study a career of choice during their high school career would prepare them for college. Having students identify a career during there high school years would give them a better feel to go to college right after high school. Your resume would look much more achievable when colleges see you have earned a certificate for mastering a career you choose to learn during your time in high school. Learning something you want to do in the future would prepare you for college because it would almost be the same as attending a college, but without all the nice technology or lab equipment colleges or universities have. Others would disagree when i say that students should identify a career of choice when entering high school and I understand why. While some parents would want there child to study a career earlier in life, other would recommend that they shouldnt be pressured in to choosing some sort of career when entering high school because it can be really stressful for the students to already having to chose a career to pick right after middle school and other parents want there kid to enjoy life as teenager and then worry about that later. The first reason I understand, but picking a career of choice is super beneficial to that student because studying it and then getting a certificate to when passed the class will lead you to many opportunities during your years in high school and would put you ahead of many others. This is why I believe students should identify a career when entering high school. It puts them ahead of the game and prepares them for college and the future. I also believe that we should have every high school in the United States offer some sort of options of careers that students can take during there high school career and that the schools can teach in all high schools around America.

583,2929,A8DFA8766B31,"I think for my opinion students should and shouldnt use their phones at school. because the good thing about it is faster and its easier because students now days use their phones every day. The bad things about students using their phones in class its that it could be a distraction for them doing their work and many more things. The bad things about students using their phones are that students wouldnt pay attention in class and would be lazy to do their work at school, thats why the schools have computers and a librarys so we could look up information for their subjects. Its a distraction and wouldnt let them learn or do their work. cause now in these days all teenagers use their phone for everything. Lets say if the teacher let the students use their phone so they can look up information for their work. Im pretty sure mostly of the students would be doing something is like being on social media or texting their friends. Thats why school is a place to get your education by learning and paying attention. Even students now this days they get mad if the teacher ask for their phone cause they use it allot in class. Students learn more faster by reading n doing their work and using their head. Cause if they use their phone they going to be looking up the answers. I think what should teachers do is that they should give their phone to the teacher once you get into class and once the class ends he should give it to you back. Another bad things about phones is that they use them on the test to look up the answers n dont try. The good things about using your phones is that it easier to use then a computer and it so much faster. I think students should be allowed cause you could learn from their n look up information or things that you dont understand in class and you could find another way of learning and different ideas. The other good reason your better on typing on phone then using computer. I think its a good and a bad idea cause with your phone its quicker to use then a computer but the bad thing about its a distraction to student. Cause they would putting more attention to their instead of the teacher. And student get distract with their phone cause they access to social media at the same time. And student would cheating on test cause they would be looking up the answers. Students now in this days have to use their phones less cause they use them every day n not their and thats the reason they dont learn.",7,6,7,5,7,5,2255,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

585,2931,15D10C4DBA29,"Have you ever assist a older student and a younger student from involving a program? It is better from involving a program so they can talk to each other and communicate others, if they are struggling with some work or if they need to stay after school which is important for them to get good grades. I agree that older students should assist younger students from involving a program because they can help together and cooperate together, if older students want to enjoy a after school activity if they like being it, they can learn about social skills. I think that cooperating together for students is good because they can hang out and talk with their phones while their at school and they can work as a group of doing a project which is good for them to do if their kind of bored and they can work together of doing a skit or a play or act they like to do and last they should book buddy which that means reading as a group or playing card games each other. I think that older students like to enjoy a after school activity because they like to do video games because i know that some students always stay after school for video games because they like it a lot they like to play games each other which i play video games with my friend, and students might say Yay i like to stay after school to play video games again. I think that students should learn social skills, because they can educate themselves of liking it, and there is a another club that is called Personal development which is a good club of social skills so that students like it a lot and their is some fun things that students like one of the activities are really fun for them. In conclusion, students should help together from cooperating together because they can get to know themselves and they can be happy and they award themselves from accomplishing goals that they do is important for them, and if they get all As they can improving themselves from their teachers saying "" Students have accomplished their goals because they are on time to class they respect teachers, and students working and cooperating together of doing kinds of work they like to do is best for them.

Lets say that students want this the same school schedule that has a longer winter break, a year-round schools, and a week off in the spring and fall because people want more time to do spend time with family, do homework, projects etc... First, We can spend time with family and friends, we can watch a movie with them, eat food together as a family, have parties and celebrate at our house. We need families to stay together as a group because if we dont then we are going to miss them too much as we go to college or get our new place to live. Nobody wants to stay alone because if they want to stay alone thats okay if you want. Second, We can go on a vacation to the beach, the pool, Disney world etc... I love going to the pool in the summer because we dont have to stay at our house all day and all night. There is so much to do outside then just staying inside and doing nothing. We must stay with our family because they love you so much and they want to spend time with you too. Finally, We can relax from work and studying we are tired of working so hard that we need a break. We are studying so hard for school, we did lots of tests and quizzes that we are tired from. We all enjoy summer vacation because we can spend time with our family and friends, we can invite our friends to eat , go to mall, watch a movie etc...

587,2933,F58DF8739B42,"Dear Mr. Principal today I want to talk abot how most employees are looking for a specific characteristics in potential employee even if they dont know the job. I agree with this prompt because a person not always know how to do a job, but they can learn. Some people when they are new on a job they dont really know what to do, they have to be trainig for another person that alredy know the job like a manager, maybe employees are looking for a manager, the person they contract to be the manager maybe her/ him dont have the experience at all, but they can learn over the time they are working. For example when I came to this country I start to work with my stepfahter to put ruffin, I didnt know how to do the job, bit I learn over the time that I work with him. Last summer I was working on a restaurant like a cashier and I had a problem because I didnt know the differences on the coins because in my country it was really different, but I learn a lot because the manager from the restaurant help me to be succesful on the job, and I put a lot of eargerness to leanr the job. A lot of people when they know the job they like to work hard becuase they want to learn more about it, some people that alreayd know the job they can learn new things about the job from another employee or manager. A lot of people here in United States work hard for the benefits of their family not just for a benefit to be hired, They know that if they work hard their childrens can leanr abot their experience, and they can be a better person, a lot of parents like to be a example for their childrens, so the way their childrens know that work hard is something that you need to be proud of. Some of them work hard to achieve their goals, or to have a better future. However, be responsable is another important thing that you need to keep in mind, be responsable can help you to get hired on the job, if you are responsable the main boss are going to see that they need people that are responsable to be more succesful. A lot of companies grow up because their employee are responsable, and they complete all the activities their boss ask them to do. When I was in my country a lot of people tried to put like a store, but it never work because the people they put to work they didnt show up on time, and they werent responsale on their activities, and the store had to close because they didnt improve what they want to do. Be responsable is one thing that is going to help you to be succesful in life becuase if you are new to a job and you show up on time they are going to see that you are really responsable with your activities and thats what most of the jobs are looking for people how are responsable. Another thing that employers need to know that they have to contract a person that is going to have patient, in every job they have a manager and employers should know if the manager have the patient to be training people that is new on the jop. Lets do a example some managers are impatient they dont like to help people that dont know the job because they said that they dont have the time to be training people because they think that the person is never going to learn how to do the job, or they have another important activitie to do instead of be training a new person. In a lot of restaurants or stores the managers are always with good actitude and they like to help people. In my conclusion I would say that a employee dont have to know how to do a job if they are responsable and they like the job him/her are going to learn what they need to do to be succesful on the job. Another thing is that you dont born with experiences you need to learn from the callenges life give to you and you can learn from your mistakes.",6,6,7,5,6,4,3655,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Reasons.

My first reason is we have more activities help our body to be active ,and health for example when we play some games like, soccer, baseball, track, our body imediatilly is activated, because we need to be active and that helps that our body can be healthy, and that prevent some diseases because if our body is inactive we can feeling,sad and stress. My second example is, when I went to field trip, I was happy ,because I went to some place where I can distracted and relax with the nature, and that help me because doing activities that maintain the body active and it is more helpful for our mind. My second reason is get more possibilities to be someone in the life,for example, we can always pay attention in the classes,and concentrate, we need to be more active the mind because that help learn more and that too help in the future. My second example is, last year wanted to pass my grade, I needed to be active in my classes and had better scores in all my classes and do my homework, so I can pass my classes because I was active and all my classes and homework, and I put attention all that the teacher said me during the class. Some people think to be active is not help in the life, and idles is more better than active because, people said to be active people can get transtorn in the mind. But they are incorrect because, development our mind for example, sometimes we can feel depress we dont want to do nothing, our mind is develop each day about the activities, works, and other things what do each day, and that help to our mind be more active. In conclusion, to be active people can do more activities, get more possibilities to be someone in the life, and develop our mind each day, to be active one of the most important things because that help to our body and, our knowledge that we have and we need.",6,5,5,5,6,7,3513,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
595,2941,C61946131A41,"Identifying a career at a young age. Identifying a career at a young age may be difficult for some students ,most of them think different ,some of them doesnt even care about their future or what they are going to do with their life ,parents may think this is a good idea because they want a good life and good future for their childrens and want them to be successfull and this will change their perspective of thinking. Although some people think that this idea is a bad idea , and this is going to be hard for students,because the students are going to have more homework,projects,test to get prepared for their career and some quizzes too,Actually people this days is use to only if the students gratuated and get out of school is when they have to start thinking on what the students want to do or work , for example if students finish high school and they start to work in a regular work like a restaurant,they may think im already here working good ,I get pay good ,why would I go to school again,I dont need to go school again just to spend money ,Im good like that just getting my own money to wasted only for me,and this would be the way he is thinkg because when he was in high school; people didnt talk to him about careers when he was at school. One reason for start identifying what students want at a young age is because they would have a lot of time to think what they really want in their life ,for example if a student is in 9 grade and he says I want to be a police and then he is in 11 grade and he think different and he wants to be a doctor,he would a chance to change his career because he had time to do it , another example i can give if like what is a student want to start knowing how his career work, like the doctor career he may wanna know how much credits he need to make in high school , how many years his career is going to take ,if he is going to have the opportunity to go collage, would he be able to pay his career,thats why is a good idea to start thinking at a young age,and start to getting prepare for what he is going to do in his career. Another reason for start thinking what the students want in their life,is that they may know on what they are good at,to know their self,and start to think if they are going to be successfull in their future ,they may start doing good in high schoool to do credits and try to get a scholarship ,for example the student finish high school and he is going for his career maybe a doctor and at the middle of his preparation for being a doctor he saids Im not good at this and this career is not going to a successfull for me I would only give up a this point , he may think this way because he didnt have opportunity to change what he wannted to change ,why? because the school start to talk about this when he was in 12 grade and he did have change to think well,he didnt have chance to change his way of think ,another example I can give is that some students like latinos students , some of them doesnt have a good economical life and this may be hard forsome of them on finishing their career ,so they have to start getting credits ,start to get good grades to get a scholarship, Because most of the latinos students want to be successfull in their ife and this would work for them ,Identifying want students want for their future at a young age is good ,because they know what they really want and this really work In conclusion ,Identifying a career at a young age is good because the students will have they time to know what they really want ,and to know on what they are good at,and start to do good at high school for they to graduated,the students will have more opportunities in their life is they choice a good career for their life , this is a plan that would change the way how students think;young students think better and very clear and this may guide them toward a specific career in their life.",7,7,6,6,5,6,2683,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

599,2945,76E5D0DEC30A,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. There is a quote that says, ""If you want to go fast go by yourself, but if you want to far go with someone else"". As the quote says, I think that its very important to have someone to guide us throughout the course of our lives. I agree that seeking for guidance from experts to make wise decisions can have a great impact in our lives. Experts and authorities can provide us with advices to make good decisions in life and accomplish our goals more easily. First of all, having someone to guide you throughout the decisions you make in life could help you accomplish a goal a lot easier. For example, when I was in middle school I used to think that doing individual work was faster and easier. However, I noticed that most of my classmates who worked in groups finished all the assignments in less time than I did. This experience showed me the importance of always having someone to give you their opinion to accomplish a goal quickly and avoid wasting your time. Thus, seeking for guidance from experts can help you achieve any goal you set in life and avoid wastig your time on making wrong decisions. In addition, you will learn and gain experience if you have someone expert to guide you. For example, having an expert guiding you will allow you to see his different points of view and learned from his teachings. This will allow you to learn from his teachings and experiences and reflect about them. Furthermore, relying on with an expert will give you the chance to learn new lessons and in the future give you the opportunity to make your own decisions. Finally, you will learn how to make wise choices by learning from the lessons that an expert or authority could offer you. Some people say that having someone telling you what to do will limit you from choosing whats best for you. For instance, when I was 10 years old I really wanted to make my own decisions that I thought were best for me. In whatever manner, I rarely got to choose my own decisions because my brother was always there telling what decisions to make. As I grew older I understood that my brother was just guiding me through the right path. Because my brother had experienced many of the situations I went through, he was able to help me and in many occasions avoid me from failing. Therefore, experts and authorities will be there to not let you fail and always look for whats best for you. In conclusion, seeking from guidance from experts may not give you the freedom to make your own decisions, but it will help you accomplish your goals rapidly and efficiently. Since experts have already experienced many rough situations in life, they will know how to make decisions that will benefit us in the best way. Furthermore, in the course of the path with an expert guiding you, you will learn a lot of things that will help you make better choices. Finally, you will avoid wasting a lot of your lifes time trying to follow your own instincts and ideas.

600,2946,EFDAD69E103B,"I have being asked to explain the effects of a program involving pairing, older students , and younger students. Some schools have a program that pairs older students and younger students. I think that a program like that will be helpful. The older students are available to assist the younger students. This program can be helpful, to both the older and the younger students, because both the younger and older students, can learn new things from their opponent, or classmate. Also is fair that the older students assist, the younger students, so both of them can be sucessful. Like maybe the younger students can teach the older students, some new skills theve learned in school, or somewhere else. Or maybe how theyve learned to play baseball or softball. The older students can teach the younger students, how to do algebra / solving equations or how to ride a bike. Helping out younger students helping order students can be fun and can also turn out to be great. Or sometimes bad. Like for example, in my school, they have a club that both younger and older students can be in. It is free and not obligatory. So me and some of my friends, joined that club. And also some othe r students. Some of the older students, helped us, if we needed help, and we also helped them if they needed help. Every time during that club we each bring our own snacks or the teacher gives us some snacks himself, and we get to work. That club at school was so helpful for me and my friends, because we can get our homework done in time, and some older students or adults assist us if we need help. Me and my friends also enjoyed that club because it was fun at certain time. In conclusion, pairing older students , with younger students, can be very helpful to certain people in need. Being kind an cooperating is the best thing to do while being in a club or working with younger and older students.",8,7,8,7,8,7,3525,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
601,2947,1214E4605B0C,"Should the school break system be change to 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break , and a week off in the spring. Some educator feel that the summer break is to long and students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Others argue that summer break is for students to take a mid break and stop think about school. Schools should not change the break system, because many students and parents had already planed,what they would do during the summer, and because many students work, and by changing the break system it could affect them, and because summer break is for students to relax, get a mid break and stop worrying about school. The school break system should not be change to 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the the spring, because many students work during the summer and many jobs do not gives students the opportunity to work only a few week or days,they want students work a lest two months so they can be able to give them the jobs, otherwise they would give the jobs to peoples that can stay more time with them. For example I work during the summer, and the company that I work with, only gives jobs to persons how agree to stay more than two months with them, if the school system change, this clear is going to affect me, because I going to lose my job and it would be difficult for me, to find another job during the break, because most of the jobs do not want people, how just going to stay in the company for a few days or weeks. The school break system should not be change , because students and parents have already planed , where they going to go, and what they going do, and if the school change the brake system, most of the plants that they had already made it, are going to be destroy . for example my bother and my parent visit my grandparents every single year and if the school break system change this could be a problem because they would have to come back more soon, and probably they may not go. The school break system should not be change, because students have the right to have a long break and stop think about all those worksheet,quizzes, and tests that ,they had already done during the school period,summer break should be a time to relax spent time with family and friends and not a time for be think and worry about school. Considering all this factors that I just talk about, I clear believe summer break, should stay the way its, because it has being working like that for many year.",8,7,7,7,7,6,247,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

Went you meet a new person you got to show your best impression be respectful, helpful, and have some good attitude. The first impression is something the you cant change later on the future,because is something the you make or the other person make. On your first impression you need to give your on personality you done want to act different, because then later you going to want to change and you going to make the other person think different about you his going to think you not the person the her knows. The first thing you show on the first impression is respect. The way you act around the person, things the you do when you with the person, The language the you used around the person. Also you need to be helpful for the person, show the person the you care about it. Help one each another, and work together. Be happy around the person, your first impression is the one the is going to show your personality. Also have the person talk about her life. Let her know you wants to know a little more about her, tell her if she need something let you know you always going to be there for her. Make her feel like she won one person not the she have something the is going to rude is life.

603,2949,C495D1E686C0,"From my point of view, this is a good idea because most students have a different situation in their life. Sometimes, they woud like to become an independent person, so nobody can coerce to do something even their parent. In my eyes, it is not important that the students finish high school in three year or four year. After graduating from high school, they are a good person, arent they?. I think this is a most important problem. To me, the students should be a good citizen because the society needs them to develop. A good behavior is more necessary than graduation, and they have to practise or use the lesson that were learned in high school, so they will get a lot of experience. The life is an adventure, discovery, and study. Day by day, everything is changing rapidly. Due to this problem, the student not only study in textbook, or document but also learn from substantial. When we face up with difficult problem, it gives us more valuable experience in the life, i think this experience is too hard to find in book, or school. If you graduate in high school early it will give you more time to learn new things from your life, so you will grow up and have a lot of opportunities to success in life. For instance, Generic_Name who i admired, was a founder the Coffee Shop Company in my country. He was still graduate high school early and then i worked for his company. At that time, he was learning how to grow a special coffee, which is the only one not only in vietnam but also over the world. At the present, his company is the best coffee company in Vietnam. He said to me that difficulty, experience are the keys to success. Actually, the life is a challenge: it isnt easy to you. If you would like subdue it you have to prepare everything as soon as you graduate high school. Therefore, the student finish high school early; it is very neccessary to prepare for new challenges in the life. As we can see, the economy is delicated and various, so you have more time to find an occupation which is suitable for you. I believe that 50% senior were confusing about their future because most of their time is in school, class, which forgot going ouside to expand your knowledge and doing some part-time jobs to get new lessons. In my opinion, most of people fall down in their life because of lacking of experience. In short, i support this idea because it make us mature, independent.

604,2950,33F18D5D8867,"Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home help then not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by students getting to much school work that cannot all handled in one night. Everyday kids complain about having to much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at home gain more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at school helps kids to succeed and have better grades. No only does learning at home provide less distraction, it provides students with flexible schedule. First, Students complain about having to much homework because students who spend a lot of time on their homework and dont have enough free time for them to relax is considered having to much homework. When they get out school and they have to practice some sports them they have to go to their house just to eat and them to do their homework, they cannot spend time with their family. Homework can limit the time. Students can spend with their friends, family, or other activities they can do. Too much homework can also give students more pressure from parents interference, this may cause unhealthy amount of stress. This is why students prefer home school. Second, One of the best things about home school is that It can be done at anytime because It can be done at any time, children have a flexible time schedule with mean that the parents can helps. The student can work around schedule instead of the parent working around the students schedule. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. Home schools allow students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homeschooling is that there are not rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules, the students can focus on their studies. Third, when you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are may distraction that can make students loss focus on what there are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit student. Learning from home wont have the distraction that that a classroom has. As a result of this, student wont loss focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reason students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment they are no familiar with, which makes then feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and wont stress about work. In a school, you are stuck at desk for 6 hours and have limit time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This does not helps students at all. In conclusion, the environment at home will benefit students by giving them better grades. In conclusion, Students should be offered classes online because the environment is less stressful, which could benefit test scores. At home there is less distractions, rather than at school where are many different things to worry about. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. Many students successfully take some, and even all, classes from home. School systems and all districts should offer distance learning. ",8,9,8,8,8,9,672,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

606,2952,66C2FA45A48B,"Energy and many different resources are a big patrimony that nature gave us,every single person need to take care of every single resource that we have like energy,water,etc. All of those resources complement each other to do their functions for example: without water we would not have energy,water helps to make energy when it is coming down like a waterfall,so there is when water produce energy. We also know the sun is an energy reproducer and we can get a natural energy,the type of machine that is used for that kind of energy is a little expensive,but is better than a normal energy that we use every single day, it is less dangerous for our enviroment. An example of sunlight energy can be the calculators that need to be charged with light,so they do not need batteries which is a good one. The government and obviously every single person need take care of this amazing resource to conserve it for a long time. Conserve and earn energy is a big challenge for all,we thought that little things like leave the lights turn on for along time and do not use them is a loose of energy and money,those little things affect us believe it or not and of course affects our aconomy. Energy is one of the most expensive resources,we pay for electricity,because to reproduce energy it goes through an expensive process. The prompt says that adopt a four days of work with each day consisting of ten hours it is going to conserve more energy. I thing that can help us to reduce the lost of energy,but at the end we make the change. I think ten hours of school is not going to make a big difference,first of all that change will create many conflicts with students who practice a sport,have things to do after school,or need to work after school the time is not going to adjust. Parents will get in troubles to pick their children or to leave them in an extracurricular activities,even if the school adopt that proposal that does not mean that all of the jobs and schools are also going to adopt it,so that is going to affect families who have children in that school. I believe the change is going to be stressful for many parents who both of them need to work. One example can be when people who need a babysitter to take care of their children,we know that person also have a family or have things to do after job and if her job take more time that she usually do is going to affect her. Not all of the people are able or agree to work till late,and if they accept they want to be paid more. Having a long days of school,I mean more hours that we used to do can be stressful for students that are very mischievous or rude,they just want to go home early as they can and if the school add more hours they are going to be more rude than they are. We are teens,we just want to have a good adolescense. The good thing is that we are going to have one more day off out of school. We used to have two days out of school,but now we are going to have three,so if we add the days like early dismissal,vacations,or because of the weather those are going to be lost days,in fact we are going to lost more days,so I think that is going to affect our academic life. The period of time that we used to have to finish the unity for each class sometimes does not adjust and we get busy,imagine if we just have four days of school plus the teens that like to be absent. In fact,all in the world has advantages and disadvantages as I mentioned. One of the advantages that I can see is that teenagers are going to be more hours doing good things being in the school,and not waisting their time doing things that are disturbing for them. We usually go to school an average of seven hours,if the businessses want to add two or three more hours to be in total ten hours taking out one day,and becoming just four days of school each day ten hours of work,In my opinion is going to be the same,because the two or three extra hours that they would add is the same that one more day of school;however,what is going to happen with the students that are in sports,have other activities or students that are in clubs,they will going home till night,I believe that is not good for anybody,they are not going to have time to do their homework for the next day,or an extra activity if they want during the rest of the day. In conclusion let the things stay same till this day,we can conserve energy doing other type of proposal that not affect too much the people and their activities. We can start doing little things like turning off the lights of our house when we do not stay there,or when we do not use them. Those are my thoughts,so we can help our world being more educated with our enviroment and the resources that they provide for us. Energy is something indispensable in our life,so if we do not take care of that resource we are going to have a lot of problems in the future,as energy become more expensive or something like that. We can provide huge things to our country and the world if we want.",7,6,6,6,6,5,1336,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

If we could have classes at home students wouldnt have to worry about sleeping in class and getting yelled at by the teacher. Most students wanna be home school because they either get bullied, tired of getting in trouble, but mostly students these days wanna graduation early. If we also had classes at home more kids will be more safer than at school since whats happening right now in 2018. students wouldnt have to deal with getting suspend or expelled because most kids these days get that. School wouldnt have to deal with drugs, gang violence, or anything thats harmful to the school. Then school drama wouldnt happen a lot in school if we could just be home. It will also be a great idea if we could attend classes from school and at home. It wouldnt be a good idea because most students wouldnt do anything or make someone else do it. Some students like to be teach in person and if they were at home then they cant learn at all. some students are just too lazy. What about gym and other non core classes? We could have a time when they gotta start there class and if they dont sign in then they get mark absence. If they have a non core class then they can just go to school to take it but most classes you could probably take online. I hope you think about changing school to allow students to take classes at home, or allowing them to take some at home, or both. Thank you for reading my paper hopeful you thought about everything and how it could change everyone problem. have a wonderful day!",6,6,6,6,5,7,1506,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
608,2954,B3B9D116021C,"People tend to think that setting a goal high to achieve is a smart idea. While the other side thinks that setting a goal low is the better. Although some people may hate setting a goal high and falling short, it can cause a person to give up, but they forget to neglect the part that goals or achievements come in different shapes and sizes. People should be aiming their achievements high because people can achieve more, people can feel more motivated, and people can feel more successful. Some people may not agree with this position because setting a goal to high and then falling short can cause a person to feel less motivated. they believe this because when setting a goal high and it fails, it can make a person give up and not try. they may think this because when giving up on a goal it can cause a person to feel empty and wanting to not try again. this shows that some people are afraid of failing, and when they do fail it makes them not try again. However, the oppositions looks over other important points. People should be aiming their achievements high so they can achieve more. when a person sets their goal high, it could mean they are setting multiple goals and not just one, having one goal is great, but having multiple is also fantastic. this can also make the person feel good about themselves, knowing that they have accomplished more than one achievement. it can also make them feel proud about themselves. Even if a person failed one goal that doesnt mean they cant accomplish other goals. People cannot accomplish every goal, all goals are different then one another, but other harder goals can be accomplished. people should be aiming their achievement high because it can make a person feel more successful. Once a person has completed an achievement it can make them as if they succeeded. it can also help with their confidence, it would give them less anxiety. it also shows that the person who is working towards his or her achievement can do so much more. it can also help some people in the future because they have the confidence they need because they hit different goals. people can also feel like they did something with their life and not feel like they did not accomplish anything in life. People should aim their achievements high because they can feel more motivated. Setting an achievement means working really hard. It means you must focus on, it should be the only thing you are working on. Most people in their mind focus on this and this is what motivates them to work on one persons goal. In their brain they get this sense of energy, their brain is telling them to work on their goal. that is what make some people want to work towards their goal or try to finish their goal. So this is why aiming your goal high is a good thing, motivation, success and achieving more can help a person in life if trying complete an achievement. People can get scared of goals, they are afraid it could fail something could go wrong, but the thing is in life you will fail, nobody is perfect, people will have get over their fears and accomplish their goal.

609,2955,85F5FADDDC0E,"Heres a fact why you should go to the museum, going to a museum helps you pay attention more. A museum is an enjoyable, education activity heres why I think it is, you can be with your friends,learn new things school hasnt taught you yet,you get to move around. First of all, you can hang out with your friends, so both of you can learn together, understand, spend together so you both can know each other better. Usually when you hang out with someone when its not during school you can build your friendship stronger, trust each other better. You feel a lot comfortable around people when you both learn together. Bonding together with someone is really important helps you communicate to your friends, when you forget what happen the next day you could ask your friend. Secondly, you can learn new things school hasnt taught you yet, or understand things school taught you, but you forgot half of the things. You can review it again, you can also be ready when school teaches you that lesson or subject and you would already know what happen. Study shows if you go to a museum you will likely pass that class youre struggling with. When you go to a museum, improve you listening skills and pay attention better, later on you can pass your tests and SOLS. Finally, you get to move around when youre in school your brain gets tired so it focuses on other things when it should be paying attention,your brain pays attention when youre moving. When youre sitting down you usually think about sleeping soon, and you forget things fast when you dont pay attention and get a bad grade in that class. Or forget what to turn in,or even forget to write important things down like notes, tips, what youre gonna do tomorrow in school. Moving around calms your brain down and your body too, you wouldnt feel rushed, or you wouldnt feel sleepy at all. In conclusion, this is why you should go to a museum, you can be with your friends, learn about new stuff you didnt know about, and move around.

Especially, teenagers now days get more in trouble late at night because they do illeagal things. often times teens go to parties and drink underage which is bad for their health. usually, curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because, if there was no curfew teens would stay out late, do illeagel stuff ,and get them self in deep trouble. Teenagers would be in trouble and also in danger if they dont follow the curfew. It is dangerous for teens to stay out late because the world we live in now is not as safe as we think it is. There has been a lot of kidnapings and sex trafficking happening in the United states it is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew. If they want to go out somewhere past the curfew then they always have a choise to go with their parents. Usually, most teens dont have a license so they would uber their way to wherever their destination is and ubering at night is dangerous because, teens can get kidnap or anything bad can happen to them, so that staying out after curfew could get teens in trouble and in danger. If teenagers start to stay out after the curfew technically they would be breaking the law. They can get in a lot of trouble from their parents and the police for breaking the law. Teens tend to go to parties a lot and they drink under age which can get them in trouble with the law and also it is bad for their health. Another example why teenagers shouldnt be out after curfew is because, most teenagers when they go to paties they smoke which is really bad for their health. The parties they go to are sometimes on weekdays and it ends around 2-3 in the morning which is way past the curfew. If the teens come home that late at night they wont be able to get proper sleep because, they have school so getting less than 5 hours of sleep is not good for teenagers health at all. It is best for teenagers to stay home after curfew and get a good night sleep. Now days teenagers dont spent so much time with their parents. The curfew could help their parents spend some extra time with their kids. If the teenagers wants to hangout past curfew they can always go to their friends house or their friends could come to their house with their parents permission and they can hangout and be safe at the same time. Staying after curfew would definetly keep teenagers out of danger and trouble. Teens can aslo have extra time to their homework. It is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew for their own safety. All the reasons that are above is only because, so it shows what would happen if the teens dont follow the curfew. If the city council wants to keep the kids safe, healthy, and out of danger they should definetly have the curfew. The best way to keep the kids safe is to make them follow the curfew for their own safety.

614,2960,8C0D50387A60,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because some people are comfortable where they are. It is alway good to go beyond your comfort zone and explore new thing. Without explore you will never know what you are cable of and you will never grow in life. It good to be satify where you are sometime, But when emergency come to need to explore to see who you truly are. He is also right because where Iam from lot of people are satify where they in life life. I believe that the more you explore the more you grow. For example If Bill Gate was satify what he master with out exploring he would had never become a billionaire and he would never discovered the microsoft. And if Barack Obama was satify with his education/knowledge he would never had became a Senator or the first Black African American president of America and he was never going to be able to share is idea with America .So with out going beyond what you have mastered you will never know who you are and what you are cable of. Explore beyond what you have mastered and there will alway be a suprise , a new talent and a new growth in life. You will never discovered your worth/talent with out trying. Some people have that mind set that if they explore they will never make it. The more you explore the farther you go in life. Always pray to advanced to a new level not the level you have master. My mom alway tell me never be happy where you at step out of your comfort zone and explored. So you will know who you truly are. For example if your boss is leave and they are looking for a new replacement for his/her position and you have knowledge/idea about the job, but you decided embrace where you are because you are scared to take a step in life. And you also have the mind set that they will turn you down. Some people in college are comfortable having there master degree but scared to get their doctorate degree because they feel that having their masters degree is the stopping point of their learning skills and they are not smart enough to get their doctorare degree. Some enviroment make you satify where you at. Being happy with where you at is not a bad thing but the more you explored the more you grow in life. Never be happy with who you are alway fight for a better future on a better life. like Neil Armstrong Said "" a gaint leap for man kind"" some people need to take that gaint leap in their life.

If you meet someone and you do something weird theyre gonna remember you as that one weird kid. it can be bad when someone have a bad impression of you when your trying to be their friend. Sometime you can change people impression of you if they get to know to know you. if your first impression isnt good it can messed up they stuff you do in life like a job interview if you dont a good impression you may not get the job. If you move to new place and your going to a new school, your going to need to have a good impression to make new friends because if your new and a lot of people dont know you and if you do something weird or dumb everyone at your new school is gonna have a bad impression of you and that may cost you to make new friends and sometimes someone may bully you for being weird. Some kids at school have bad impression and people talk about them behind their back and their made fun of them for being weird.

616,2962,ED6070D470FF,"I despise it when someone your close to says ""you cant be like me you have to be better than that."" What right do you have to speak on what I have done, when you have done things people could not even imagine? This is why when it comes to someone you look up too or base your personality off of, make sure it is one who has credibility. Like people always say ""you are who you hang around with."" For example, being around friends who act in illegal activities your bound to do those things too. A man with honor, integrity, and takes responsibility for what he does will be respected because of his behavior. Being a good role model is especially true when it comes to children. For example, have you ever had a little cousin or your bestfriends baby sibling copy the same exact words that come out of your mouth? Be careful what you talk about around a kid because they repeat what you say; furthermore, it might not seem like it, but they can process everything you say. This is how in parts of the country people have various accents and pronounce words differently. When you grow up in a certain neighborhood or even in you household, while aging you will be using the different terms and phrases people around you use because thats all you ever known growing up. So staying away from words that cant be used in a school or around familly is your best bet. A celebrity has an even greater audience when it comes to setting an example for others. People of all types of ages watch them, they are the ones who set the trends, the news revolves around, and control social media. When a celebrity messes up they get the most hate; however, if a celebrity does a great deed like a charity event then theyre praised for it. They attract the most attention and most of those eyes are teenagers, who need the most advice and a figure to follow. For teenagers this is who decides for them if theyll be on the streets or in the books because famous people are who they spend most of their time with. Teenagers are always watching, whether on social media, a reality show, a sports game, or a movie, celebrities are dominating the world right now. No mater who it is, a person always have some type of influence on somebody. That is why you should just hold that anger in next time you get in a fight because people are watching. Do some charity or show them you cleaning up the environment; in addition, just effect others in a positive way. However some would say setting example does not matter or no one pays attention to that, it is suprising how many people are effected by a persons behavior. Showing a good example with behavior does not necessarily mean change who you are, it just means be careful of the words that are exiting your mouth. No one would want their own kid to be effected by a bad role model. ",9,8,10,9,9,8,3471,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

I dont know why people dont accomplish something in life. People always says that things happen for a reason. There could be reasons of why things happen or not. In my opinion, people should always by doing something. If people accomplish what they want, then there would not be a purpose. It doesnt matter where we are, we could always be doing something.

It would be wonderful if we could help our parents at home, or, most thing may be done at home. Helping them by with laundry and cleaning the rooms, so, they dont be tire that much because they just come from work.

Some of the disease are cholesterol, diabetes, and are other more disease if you dont eat healthy or you not do exercise. Being active is very important for you and other people.

All the failures have a lesson for your life, the first reason why a failure give you a lesson is because. If you never do it wrong you will never learn about the failure. Second you learn about the failure when you made it before and you do again but now you do it good for example. If your teacher give you 10 days to do a presentation on your computer and, the first day you say i will do it tomorrow and you say the same the next day until a night before the day that you have to turn the work you start do it , and you dont have enough time and you get a bad grade. The next day it was a failure and you will learn about it because the next time you will do it on time. A failure give to you the motivation that you need to do your best the next time. When you do something wrong for first time you feel bad and you want to do it wrong again , inclusively if it was a little mistake you dont want to and you got motivation. Most the people owners of big companies obtain motivation when they have a failure on a business, they dont give up they get motivation to do their best on the next business for example. You went to your work and its your first day and your boss told you that you have to finish all of your signatures 10 minutes before the end of the day , and you finish it 15 minutes after , your boss can get mad and give you a warning and you have to get it like a motivation to do your best the next day and keep going. Each failure make you more stronger and make you be alert on your next step. The failure coming and coming on ours life sometimes it come hurt and sometimes it doesnt, all of those make you more stronger, give you a lesson and make you be alert for dont get it mistake again. It make you more stronger means that you dont gonna feel weak again when you commit a mistake , also you gonna be alert and take your precautions on your next step for example. If you are on a team of soccer and you are the goalkeeper, and while you are talking with a friends , one of the other team hit the ball and make a score it was your fault. Your coach gonna scold you for it but you gonna be alert for the next time and you also gonna be more stronger because you learn about of your mistake.

619,2965,5923F6631724," Why do we have to go school for eight and a half hours for five days per week? We cant do anything after school! Please imagine that situation. If that situation became for real, how are students going to react to it? Of course, they are going to be mad, and they might have more stress. Therefore, although some people agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day because students can have time for studying, and it is very educational for them, I disagree with that idea because it interferes their family time and after school activities, and it is going to become cause of they have more stress. First of all, students cant have time for family and other activities. At recent, many kids hang out with their friends than families especially teenagers. I think students should have more family time to having great relationship with thier families. Additionally, some students have activities after school. Activity is an essential way to relax and have fun, and it also helps students find new hobbies and make new friends. As a result, if adding one and a half houres to school, it steals a lot of wonderful opportunities from students. Second, it gives more stress to students. Some students have large amount of stress already. During the school week, they study for about seven hours per day, and sometimes they need to work on project and study for quizes and tests. Also, they have homework at least one subject everyday. Thats why students have a lot of stress. To decrease their stress, school needs to give a time to relax for them after school. In conclusion, adding more time to school has many disadvantages for students. Students need family time and time to work on their activities after school to have fun and relax. School is not a place that give a stress to them. School is a place that give a opportunity to get interesting knowledges to them. I believe school should overrule this idea if you think about students.",8,7,7,6,5,7,1154,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

I personally think that, this is not exactly the right way to conserve your energy and keep your body healthier. On the other hand, I would agree that you would earn more money an have better opportunities in your career despite your personal life. As far as I understand business companies like Management, Grocery stores, or car dealers have a 8 hour shift Including Schools and government jobs etc... If people would work 4 days a week and 10 hours a day It would totally not be good for their healthy and personal life. First of all, If you work 10 hours a day and 4 days a week you would not have enough time to rest. As a result you would definitely be tired, exhausted and having a bad mood for not getting enough sleep. Second of all, when It comes to your personal life there would not be a family time, and no time to go out with friends therefore, I conclude that the concept of having a 10 hour shift a day would definitely not be that best way to live your life. In terms of education, specifically talking about schools. Since Im a student I would not be exited about attending to class for 10 hours a day. Basically because I have responsibilities outside. For example, I have to go to work, study for school and attend to my soccer training during the weekends. Also I would not be able to go work by the time school ends during weekdays and Im sure there are students like me who have responsibilities to care of outside of school. Now If I have to attend school for 10 hours a day and 4 days a week I can definitely say that my learning would get affected instead of improving. Nevertheless, I would not able to memorize everything Im learning in class, because there would be a lot more topics to go over. As a human being my brain and body needs to rest, so I can keep all the information I have learned in class. In conclusion, whether about going to school or work for 10 hours a day would not be beneficial for your professional and personal life for many reasons. For example, It could affect your health and your emotions which could lead you to be stressed out or having a bad mood not to mention that It could also affect your personal life by not having the necessary time to take care of your responsibilities outside of work.

623,2969,CD9FDD5F9F9E,"Does failure play a big role in success? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that, ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although failure often just ends up in failure, I agree with Winston Churchills statement that failure can lead to success if people continue to use enthusiasm. First of all, many of our inventions used today are a result of failures. For example, Edison created the lightbulb, but failed many times before he discovered electricity. He used his faith and motivation to not give up and keep trying even though he had many set backs. He accidently made a circular shaped like glass ball which became a source of electricity. If Edison did not keep trying, we would not have electricity today. Also, many scientists have created medicines after many failed attempts. For instance, there is now a chicken pox shot that prevents people from getting the chicken pox. Through many experiements with mixure of chemicals and failed trials, scientists were eventually able to find a shot that prevents chicken pox from entering your system. These examples show that failures often lead to success if people never give up trying. Second of all, many students have failed in school, but if they keep trying and keep their enthusiam, they will succeed. For example, I have had a hard time in school, especially with passing my sols. When time goes on, I try harder and harder, and spend more time studying with my teacher. As of today, I have passed all of the sols I need in order to graduate except for the one I am writing about right now. I also have a learning disability and ADHD and have a hard time paying attention and often lose focus in my classes. Even with my disability, I have not given up and keep coming to school and get extra help from my teachers so that I can graduate this year. I make sure I follow the rules, dont skip class, or dont miss school becuase its so hard for me to make up what I miss. Although many seniors like to skip class, I do not skip becuase I want to earn a high school diploma. Even in education, there are failures, but through hard work and a good attitude, students can succeed. In conclusion, I agree with Chruchills statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of entusiasm."" Even though people will experience failures, there will be success if they work hard, keep the enthusiiasm, and never give up.

624,2970,E660157F81B4,"A lot of people ask for an advice, but others ask more then one person for an advice. An advice means talking to someone for a recommendation. Some people ask one person for an advice. Other people talk to different people. Talking to one person can help, but asking more than one person can help you understand something better. If i am about to do something that i can get in a big trouble for should ask my parents or other adults for an advice. I would ask different people for an advice, because i can understand something i could do better. Another good thing about asking for an advice is that if i go to like prison for murder, drugs or alcohol, in the future when i go look for a job nobody will want to hire me because of the stuff i did. If i am going to do something really bad in school i should think about consequences that will be and ask someone or more people if it is going to be worth of doing. When i am having trouble doing something or understanding something i should ask others a advice of whats a good way or doing it. I think that other people should really ask for a advice. If someone wants to do something bad that they can get in trouble or they can ask for an advice. Is someone wants to make new friends they can ask something for an advice to tell them how they can talk to new people.

625,2971,C37F09E24836,"In some Schools not only do teachers assist students but now students beginning do the same for younger ones at School. Some Schools have programs that teachers allow students to pair up with younger ones at the Elementary Schools. In this program students do games read books and so much more exiting activities. They do this to help out younger students that are just beginning school and are scared and dont know what to do in School or how to react because of their first time being in School. The older students assist out the younger ones on how to read, comprehend and to get the understanding of how books are read and what they could be used for in their future life, this is the reason older students are so helpful and useful. Another amazing this program is useful is because for those students that are home alone and have no older brothers or sisters, this program helps them get a understanding of how it feels having siblings at home. This program entertains and not only that but also influences younger students on how it feels having a sibling at home and the amazing time spend with each other as well. I think this is a wonderful and interesting idea because it interests kids and makes them want to return to School and love School if they are having second thoughts about School, for example if they do not like it and dont want to return, having a buddy might want to change their mind because they can only imagine the fun and exiting time they can have with their buddy! Teacherss, Principals and other members like the School bored did a smart plan of creating this fantastic program of older students assisting out the younger students and teaching them a thing or two about certain things. Younger students look up to the older students and the older students are known as role models because they are much more mature and that is why younger ones look up to them. The reason why this program is helpful for both younger and older students is because this program impacts both younger and older students, it impacts the younger ones because it teaches them how to read and write and it impacts the older students because they learn how to assist younger ones and how to communicate with them. This great program will help out students right now in class and also they will learn how to use these skills in a daily life and maybe on their everyday lifestyle and jobs. When a student or any person assist out another, at the end they will always feel proud about their selfs and they will want to keep on helping others in their daily life. That is why they might have this program so students can get the feeling of how it feels helping out someone and so the younger students can learn how to read and get the feeling of how it the sensation would feel if they had siblings at home. They might fight but at the end they will later then respect each other and they will learn how to communicate with each other. School is important because students learn from their mistakes and then next time the same problems happen to them they will learn from it and make it better then the first time. They learn and learn so when a student is a fully grown adult they know what is expected of them and how to assist others if needed also they will be more mature and will know how to act. if someone is out their struggling or having a difficulty time doing something, the adult that was ones a students and helped out younger students will automatically know what to do and how to help the ones that will need help. This is the reason this program is so helpful and I hope they keep having these things for students in the past and will continue to help them in the future.",6,6,8,8,7,7,2640,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Based on my experiences, I disagree with this statement, first impressions are made by everyone but it is not impossible to change. Your first thoughts of someone. Everyone makes first impressions of people before even getting to know them by the way they dress, and looks. Some first impressions can be changed and some cant be. First impressions is a human thing, I believe that everyone has at least made a first impression of someone and their first impressions can be impossible for them to change or it can be changed. The way someones appearances can be affected by first impressions by so many ways. That is a major cause that is first seen. The way you are approached. My Experiences can be said some of my first impressions can be hard to change, or I can be wrong about someone and my first impressions can be way off,and that person turns out to be nothing like what I have thought. This statement can be argued from two sides. Sometimes it can be impossible to change what your first thoughts can but than other times it can be changed. One major first thoughts of a person can be the way a other person dresses, the way they look they way the walk, the way they talk. There are so many things a person can have first thoughts about a human being and just assume things about before even getting to meet . There is a lot of people in this world whos first impressions are impossible for them to change and would never change. But than theirs many other people whos first impressions are changed. In conclusion, I believe that first impressions can be changed by my perspective, It is hard for someone to change the way they think of someone, but thats why its called first thoughts because it can be changed over time the way you look at someone can start to be seen differently and your thoughts will change.

627,2973,7E48A7A7B400,"When I was in elementary school, Ive always wanted to have art lessons. Art is the lesson that I would like to share with elementary school students because it could help them in several different ways. The first way art would help the students is by making them more patient. When you are doing art and using paints, sometimes you have to wait until it dries so you can add more details and etc, that is one way that art can help them be more patient. You have to be patient when you are making realistic drawings, because if you draw fast you might forget to add important details and the drawing may not come out as good as it would if you had drawn it with patience. Another way that it helps the students being patient is that they also sometimes might have to redraw it if the drawing does not come out as good as they thought it would, and that requires patience, especially if make a mistake when you are about to finish it. And also, when they are working in groups they might have to explain for the rest of the group what are their ideas and how they want to do the project, which also requires patience. The second way art would be important to students is by making them more creative. When you are making art you have to be creative and think a lot. Being creative wouldnt only help them at school, it would also help their future. For example, if the student dream about their future, then it would help them to think more and be creative about what they want to do. Being creative would help them in several ways. And lastly, art would help them be focused. When you are drawing you have to focus on what you are doing. If you lose the smallest bit of focus, you can make a mistake and might have to do everything again. Being a more focused person would also help them in life. And also, they woul need to focus in the directions when doing their work. In conclusion, art would be helpful in several ways, It would help them to be a patient, creative, and focused person. Art would help them in life and school. It would help their future.

632,2978,738112C600B8,"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In my opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be. When you first meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing but you never know what the person could have. For example you see a fat guy or female and you can be quick to judge them but you dont know anything about there life, till when you talk to them and get to know their true story that they medical conditions on why they are the way the appear and look like. You could meet a Hispanic, For example you might thing they came to US illegally, but you dont really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the united states and are legal citizens. when you see a Asian person you may think there smart because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually smart and appear to who you really think they are. Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you dont know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. If it is the car you realize the its starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking money out your pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable.

A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it.

Emyplee. First, as emyplee it was not easy to find job because of English language. So way where was applying for jobs the company require have whether Spinsh or English so I can not speak any of other, for tow year I was just home, job no money to help my family back home because of language But I did not stop after two years fund a job so I was dishwasher, it was too tough to communicate with my Mangers and employees too.

I did not let the language or anythings else to stop me back from what would me my life best. School and Study . Second , as student that was the hardest than that I though . No back round of school like knowledge or education because I never been in the school in my childhood so that made it for me so difficult to understand what the teachers were saying. So another attack of failure in my way, I did not no how to study because there was no one to help me what should I do in that time so fall at school. Because of what other people were saying about me like that impossible that you can go further than that you are now which is can not get high school diploma there were a lot of failure in my life .From failure to a big surprise that I making this year, I will be my graduation form high school and the nest will be collage. Because I do not what let other people make decision of what should I do or not. Self development Third was to wake to believe of myself and to make nay decision. there were a lot of pressure no me . I could not focus with what I was doing like school and work and other thing because of people around me. I could not eat well for two years and I got sick. All my families were worry about me.

I personally think being home schooled can have its advantages and disadvantage, you of course have benefits for example not being bothered by other classmates, and finishing your work on time without having a distraction, kids in outiside schools have that disadvantage of having classmates who dont care about there education and some kids get carried away and distracted and they end up having to repeat classes or stay another extra year, Its very different because years on years you can just retake the class at home with nobody judging you about failing, here it is like an embarassment to be seen another year so thats something to look into. Home schooled kids i would say get more attention as in that one on one attention, I would also say outside schools get the same but there are plenty of full classes and the teacher cant always get around to all students. There are lots of kids who want to be able to attend outside school but they cant for many reasons for example a disability or how they are a celebrity, being in that situation you would want to not be known like that so your just forced and obligated to attend home school and thats when home school kids would think it would be better to be attending outside school youll always be home and feel trapped youll get tired of being in your own home, It does people good being able to socialize a bit. School can also be finished faster during home school, lots of things are offered, but also lots of things are not offered for example lunch, in almost all public schools there is free lunch, free everything your getting a free education, home school is expensive and you will always provide your own food. The wifi at home will also be payed, the computer and just many things but as we know it can be beneficial in life your getting an education so its worth the spend youll get something out of it.

635,2981,6C045F130B28,"Technology in todays life is, so advance that it has both positive and negative impact on peoples life. According to me, I think that technology has change peoples style of living. Technology at some point slow downs the physical growth or development of our body and it stops us from learning new things, But on the other hand it helps us to complete many task and save time. Modern technology has negative impact on peoples life. People can check out books, shop, and play games without moving form place and talking to anyone. This leads to no physical activity, which slow downs physical development of our body. In fact, there was a survey taken few days ago and it states that more then 45% of middle schoolers in U.S.A has to take some kind of vitamin medicine as the dont eat their lunch properly because they watch t. v or phone while taking lunch, 38% middle schoolers have glasses because of sitting in front of TV or using phone all the time, and more than 46% students are overweight or underweight as they dont do much physical activities. Secondly, technology stops us from learning new things. Technology helps people to complete new task in every day life, and then we get use to taking help from technology instead of trying it our self or learning it we get a habit of letting technology do our work. For example, if our mom not stopped us form spoon feeding then we would take it for granted and never learn how to eat our self. But, On the other hand technology helps us to complete many task and save time. Technology helps us from not being delayed, it complete task 50% more faster than us, and helps us to save 25% of more time. For example, Our group got an assignment to do on Monday and the deadline to submit it was on Friday, So if i would read books to find some info, it would take me at least 2 weeks to complete that assignment, but thanks to modern technology,I was able to finish it in 3 days. At last, I would like conclude that technology plays a major role in our day to day life. It has both type of impact negative and positive and it impacts on our life, but the main thing is ""how and when we use it"". Technology changes lifestyle of people and if we use it more it slow downs our physical growth and stop us from learning new thing, on the other it also completes our task easily and faster that us.

636,2982,BE6A28051A30,"In my opinion, i completely agree with this association church statement. Success consists of going from failure to failure until you get what youre being fighting for, without losing your enthusiasm. However i realized that the time period its not the same to the one that were living on. Company Association, Churches, and Governments are not alike as before, because now if you are trying to achieve something and for some reason you failed, people will start judge on your acts that youre not capable to become your dreams reals. Eventhough failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success. I would like to share one specific example that fail is the promotion that brings you to success. I would like to lasso the example of your first day on your new job. We all passed through that situation , you feel like youre not lace in, in the directions that your boss or supervisor gave it to you to do and thanks to that some employees start laugh at you, about your failure and no one is loyal to come up to you and teaches you how to do it they stand by and wait until they see that you made it wrong then they try to help you. But, let me tell you something that you already know, the world isnt a rainbow its a very mean and nasty place and it doesnt matter how rude you are, it would put you into your knees and keep it permanently if you let it. Not you, not me, even no one hits that hard like life does. But, it doest care how it hits, the only thing that really cares is about how much you can take, how much you can get hit and keep moving forward. If you know what you worth, then go out and get what you worth, but you must have to be able to hold out hits and not to came and blame others and say; I cant be the person that i want to be, because of him or her, or anybody. Thats how winner is done. In summary all the proofs plays an important factor in how to be successful in life, sometimes is that shove that you needed to get higher.

They can use it at home to do homework and study. use it to reserch and watch visualy watch videos to help them understand things they dont know. help them communicate with teachers and other helpful resorces online. For home schooled students technology is very helpful, beacuse some student are able to learn and understand better if they got lessons online than in a classroom.

He think about that person have to be determine to do have the focus in something, But I think that it is not a good idea have the focus in something Because Everyone need to have time for their own, Also maybe try something different or find another way to do it, And maybe some plans have a lot of frustration and mental problems. First, Every person should have time for their own because having time to relax have help to have the focus later, Also have free time you can have fun, playing videogames, dancing, singing, or meet somebody, and have time with the family or just time to sleep can be a great help for a person. I think is very important have time ourown because something we dont pay attention what happen around us, or just can be tired for everyone. Second, try something new can be a good idea to have a brain storm, To really find what you or what we want to do to have all the success like Tesla of SpaceX, They are traying a lot of different things, Maybe be idle can be good sometimes and be determine but Is not a good idea. In addition, a lot of person think same like Jefferson that is a good idea be determine to do somethinng and They want to be expert in that thing , and great for They, But I think detemine to do something can have a lot of problems sometimes like frustration problems. Just imagine a person, That spend a lot of time in here determine think to do, But something really bad happen, And that work, that this person dedicate a lot of effort, and dedication, just go away and that can cause psychologist problem, Like the Real Madrid, They wogsrk very hard all season and they make a plan but everyone see what happen, nothing work and just their season just end 3 month before finish. So I think have all the focus in just one think can have a lot of problems. In conclusion, I think is very hard to say that be determine in something can cause a lot of problems like frustration or depression, And also is important to have to ourown or our family, friends, or pets, and try new things or cool thing is always is good, Never is good to do same always just you have you own thinking or own critical.",6,4,6,6,5,5,923,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

One should be allowed to grow up. It should be mandatory to do four years of high school and here is why. First of all,school prepares students to face up and go against the real world,some students may need at least one more year in school to get their mind set for their future. Staying the extra year can make the student focus more on the classes that theyre taking. If students decide to only go for three years, they can forget about sports or any after school activities they want be in. They will have to put all their effort and energy into passing their after school classes. Second of all,students can be more independent. Students learn how to manage time to do work and extra activities. Students can also learn how to be more reliable and build up their confidence on doing things on task and on time. By doing the three year only, they cant take breaks and if so the students wont have enough time to rest their bodies and be able to do what is asked. Some may argue,that students staying for three years are going to have enough knowledge to be able to take on the real world. However,students that have four years would have a more since of what they are going to do after the four years have passed. In conclusion,students should stay and have a better understanding of what is going to come up next.",9,8,7,8,8,7,777,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

Some people dont like to be always doing something; however, do we accomplish more if we are always doing something. We can accomplish more if we are always doing something because we dont get bored, we can have a good and healthy life and we can achieve what we propose. Firts, we dont get bored. For example, if we are in our home and we are doing something like cleaning the house, or cooking we dont get bored easily because we know how to spend our time. Another example, when we are doing nothing during the day, the day feel so long, but if we are doing something during the day, the day feel faster. Also, when we do something different each day we dont get bored because we dont repeat the same routine each day. In sum, focus on do always something is good to not stay bored. Next, we can have a good and healthy life. I think, if we are feeling sad, or we are having negative thoughts we can start to do always something to distract our minds and feel much better. Addionally, when we are always doing something like activities we can have a healthy life because we can spend our time doing excersises in home or going to they gym. Also, if we dont do any activities and we just spend our time watching movies or staying in bed, we can get sick because our bodys are not in movement, but if we are always doing something we dont get sick because we are having our body in movement and doing good activities. To conclude, It is important to do always something to have a good and healthy life. Finally, we can achieve what we propose. For example, if we are in high shool and we want to graduate, we have to do always something like go to school everyday, do our homeworks and pay attention to have the opportunity to graduate. Also, when we wat to get a job we need to do always something and go to find a new job to have our own money and be responsible. Also, if we are always doing something we are gona fight for what we want and we are gonna be better persons. To summarize, we have to focus and do always something and achieve our goals. In conclusion, we can accomplish more if we are always doing something because we dont get bored, we can have a good and healthy life and we can achieve what we propose. For example, We can can do activities everyday to not get bored, we can have our bodys in movement to have a healthy life and we can have good opportunities and fight for what we want.

If I wanted to learned; I would stayed at school or watch a video to how to English, biology, or what classes do I chose from. But online or video conferencing are very different. online can be probably a website, YouTube, (Example like be able watch how to do math) or other. video conferencing is probably like a chat room or some video live. Online is a great way to learn because I use on homework, essay, Google, YouTube, and other website. And here an of example. If I wanted how make a cake and when I used online website. It bring the website how to bake a cake. And there simple as that. But sometime if I ever get like a hard assignment and I checked it online, and it gave me the wrong answer, then sometimes the website cant be everything right. But I go ahead and tried other website to see if there a correct answered. Now let say that I had to studied a lion. I can go online to checked in Google and it bring me to whole bunch of website, and click one of those website to see if there a way to studied some lion or go to YubeTube to watch how scientist studied theses creatures. Video conference is probably like talking to a teacher or maybe live chat. And the way I think of the video conferencing is not to bad. It like youre teacher or someone is teaching you, and its like simpler to school. If I wanted to do it, like if there a problem that I need to fix then I go to video conference so they can helped me and the question. But I think its a great idea to do it. The way I see is online is a helpful and video conference is helpful too. But I think it like home school staying at home and studied online or video conference. So my reasons is it a way to learned fast, getting good grades, or other information that you need for the future. And here a other reason why to use online or video conference. Online is been update like a few times. For example lets say Google doc. Google doc has been one the greatest website that I ever used. In that website, you can do almost everything like book project, essay, making slide shows and other helpful tools. But video conference is pretty helpful too. And my example is like if I need help I can contact my fellow people to help me. Finally the best way to learned is sometimes online for helpful website and video conference to contact if teacher or other can help me. But I likely used online because it pretty helpful because let say I forgot a textbook and my homework is due the next day. Well I can go online and check my answer if i got it right.

644,2990,90526CA48E47,"I strongly believe art classes such as drama, acting, and music should not be a requirement for students. I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her wants to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes. First of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked thell get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with. In my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know. Music, drama, and art class are three amazing electives, and forever will be electives. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass? No sense in my opinion art allows us students to express out inner happiness, deepest emotions, and embrace them. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art. All the more reasons why I know art classes such as drama, acting, and music classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students.

I think this idea is amazing, workers would have a day off and they wont be wasting energy and resources like in a regular day of work. Therefore i think my school should follow this model and extend the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Students would be happy of having a day off, and most of them would support the idea of having a four-day school week. By following this idea, my school would conserve energy and a lot of resources such as papers, school materials, food, etc. A four-day school week benefit students and teachers in many ways, students would have a day off and time to do extra curricular activities such as sports or work, teachers would be at home and have time to spend with their kids and be with the family, and all of us would be conserving energy and resources. One disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that some parents work 5 days a week in different companies and these companies might not have the four-day work week so they wont have time to be with their kids at home in the day off, and some of them would be forced to change their five-day work week to a four-day work week, so they can be with their kids at home. Personally, i would prefer the four-day school week, because,i have a part-time job after school , it is from 5 to 10pm, and having a day off would allow me to have time to do some extra work at home and to change my schedule for in the morning so i can have the rest of the day to work on my stuffs, have time to chill, or maybe to do my homework, and help my mom with whatever she needs. Having a four-day school week, would let me have time to do a lot of things during the day, for example, babysit my little brother if my mom goes out, go to the gym or maybe help my dad.

My mom, she doesnt work, she is always at home taking care of me and my little brother, for my parents, it wouldnt be a problem for me to have four days of school a week, because my mom would take care of me during that day off.

649,2995,2B9FE67B7465,"Thesis : I believe that my school should not fallow this model because a lot of people get tired of school. Teachers get more tired than students because they work all year to make our classes and teachers need a break from school more than us, the students. It is okay to go to the school the five days of the week. It doesnt matter how hard school is, if you go the five days of the week you get less tired because classes are more shortest and you dont have to be is school the whole day. Also you have more time outside of school to go to work or go with your friends to have fun and forget of school for a bit. First, if schools do extend classes is gonna be more stressful and tired because you are going to be in school for a longest time and a lot of people dont even like school. Some people really hate school because is really hard for everyone and there are some classes that you dont even have an idea of what you are doing. Teachers know when someone is tired and they let them sleep for a while because maybe they know how is it feel being tired. Schools need to have the same schedule and dont change anything. Second, schools are not like work in a job because in a job, you have more responsibilities and they also have rights that you need to comply. Being in a job is the double stressful and tired than being in your school learning a lot of new things. Some people say that work is better than go to school, but I say that they all are wrong because sometimes in school you do nothing, you just are listening to what the teacher says and in a job if you have a little break, you use it to eat or make another job that you need to do later. They should not extend the school day but the should do it with jobs. Third, if schools extend classes you wont have time to sleep well. Thats the most important thing for students, sleep well to come to the school with a good attitude. A lot of people talk about others attitude because they are always angry, bored, or lazy but they have no idea if they sleep well or not. Some people make fun of them because they fall to sleep in classroom and thats not right, the right thing is ask that person how is he feel, or if he is okay. The less you sleep, the most tired you get and sometimes you dont even can concentrate in classroom. Most of the students that dont sleep well and they have a job after school, they have a hard time in school because most of the times being in school is stressful as a job. Conclusion : Is not necessary to extend school day two more hours because its gonna be the same any ways. Two more hours in four days dont change anything because is like you are adding Friday in that four days. The same eight hours in Friday, you are going to add to the four days of classes. They dont need to change anything because teachers wont have enough time to get ready our classes for the next day and they wont have time to even cook food at home or clean their house. Sometimes students above 18 years old live single and they need to work every single day because they need a lot of money to pay their bills like: house, car, phone, internet, food, and clothes. Some of them are about to have a baby and having a baby is a huge responsibility for him because he need to work over time to win more money or have two job. He is gonna be really really stressful and tired, and he wont have time to come to the school the whole day.",8,6,6,7,6,8,574,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
650,2996,39B3FC0EAE2A,"Imagine being a loner for the rest of your life because you only relied on yourself. This quote says "" think about the benefits working with a group or working alone."" Working alone helps you complete what is task to you with no distractions, and creates an important skill to be independent. Working in a group helps with your commutation skills, and each person has their own role to play in a group, so its less stressful. Although, working alone is more beneficial, actually, working with a group is best beneficial. Those who believe, working alone is more beneficial have a point because you dont need to relay on anyone. You have more control on what youre working on, these are also your own ideas not anyone else. Working alone keeps you concentrated on what you are working on. For an example when youre working alone its less likely to get distracting by someone. Working alone can develop independent skill, this skill is good to have in the future. In reality no one is there to hold your hand and guide you. The benefits working alone are completing your own work with your own reasons and less distractions. However, the benefits on working with a group helps to get the job done faster. Listening to what others say is great listening skills; people like when you listen to them. In a group you can combine ideas and relay on each other. For an example youre confuse you have your group to explain to you what you need to do. This benefits your commutations skills and willing to speak up when you dont understand something. There is nothing wrong with reaching out for help, it shows you want a better understanding on the topic. Working in a group also has an advantage in speeding up the possess since each person is working on what theyre assign to. Everyone has their weaknesses and strengths, the goal is to find what best fits for everyone in your group, so you work together as a team. If you make a mistake you have your group to give you feedback on what you should work on. Additionally, working in a group can reduce stress because youre only focus on one part on what youre working on. We know projects, assignments, etc..can be really stressful, all you have in mind is "" I have to finish all this."" Working in a group isnt so stressful because everyone has their own role theyre working on. Everyone relays on each other to finish their own part, so they can finish faster. In conclusion, working with a group is best beneficial because you finish your work faster and its less stressful than working by yourself. You can learn new things by working with others, also it increases your communication skills. You can also help one another by focusing on their weaknesses and giving feedback. Therefore, this is an important experience to have because in the future youll have to learn to work with one another at any job you apply to.

I agree Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. because, you make your own desicions,you take responsability,and you have goals. However many,believe that people influence the way we choose our characters because they think they have the rigth to critize the way people decides. Actually,this is a bad idea because people makes their own decisions,In society most of the time we have to take a decision whether are rigth or wrong we must take it at some point but is also,your choice to make the best out of it. For example,My brother had to take a decision by himself which was doing something in life going to collage study or work as an Mcdonals co-worker he decided the best was going to collage and keep studying. If,my brother wouldnt have taken that decision then he had lost an opportunity to make it. The second reason your character will be what your self choose to make it, is that you take responsability because taking responsabilities make a better character of your self. For example,when you wake up early just to be on time at work every day you feel you are giving the best of you yourself are choosing to make your character. If,you are not giving the best of you every day that means you are no choosing to make your own character. The third reason your character will be what your self choose to make it,is that you have goals because you want to feel satified when you have achieve something important in your life. For example,when getting your first bachelor degree when getting your dream job or you worked so hard for your dream car you always wanted. If, you dont have goals to follow then you are no going to make it. In conclusion,make your own path,you are encharge,and you have dreams to follow.

If I would have chosen this offer, I would have 3 reason why I agree that offer. Student should always think first if a school offers you something. My first reason is, student can take their time in the morning to wake up and take a shower. For example, if a student wakes up late to school, that student wouldnt have time to do stuff he/she planned in the morning. But online school, that student can wake up late and take their time what he/she planned in the morning. My second reason is that its less cheaper. In online school, students only need: a computer, notebook, and something to write with. Students also receive free food from their home. But in regular school, some student pay money to get food, and the supplies for each class can be expensive. My last reason is student sometime finish their online school early, and have the rest of the day to play games, or hang out with friends. In conclusion, student should always pick the right decision, when it comes to a offer in school. I think online school is good for students. Why, because if a student that is having family problems, and missing school every day.

653,2999,BBE74D844874,"The Ways To Success In Life Failure plays an important role in the path of success. To gain success in life we all have to go from difficult situations. We do not have to lose hope at failure. Failure is the key to success. We learn the lesson from our mistakes. If we will not do the mistake so, how would we learn the things more better. We should learn the things from our failure instead of losing hope. Encourage yourself and other when you you are facing the failure is a good thing. If someone fails again and again in their goal, we have to encourage them for not to lose hope,determination about goals and be enthusiastic. We need to help people if they need us,if we see someone who are losing their hope because of the failure, we have to encourage them for not to lose hope. Because if they lose hope, they are destroying their dreams and goals by their own hands. At least we have to try something until we reach to our goal. There was a spider, who wants to go to his home but he was not reaching to his home because it was so high, he tried first time he failed, he tried second time he failed but he did not lose the hope. When he tried the eighth time, he reached to his goal just because he did not lose the hope. We have to try as many time as we can but never lose the hope. We should have determination about our desire. If we are determine about our desire then we can reach to our goal. For the success we have to do a lot of things like hardworking but the main point is determination. For instance if we think we can not do this thing then its really happen. First we have to prepare our minds that this is my desire and I will have to reach my goal. There is nothing wrong to make or see the dreams but the determination about your dreams can take you to path of success. Be enthusiastic about your work and goal is the great way for success in life. We have to be thrill about our goal. Enthusiasm is a great thing, we have to learn from the failure with out loss of enthusiasm. In the pursuit of success we do not have to be sad. Be happy that you learn from your mistake and now u can do that better than before. From the failure we are getting more experiences. For example when teens go for their first job, they do not have experience. They do not know how to manage their time in job, how to take customers and how to deal with the difficult situations. Every day they do mostly mistake and learns from their failures. At the end of the year they are master in everything but if they do not lose hope and be enthusiastic about their work. Life is so hard but we can make it easy if we don not lose hope, be determine about our goal and be enthusiastic. To gain the success we have to do a lot of hard work but if we fail at any point we do not have to lose hope and just sit down because we fail. We have to learn from our mistake and just try, try and try until you reach to your goal. If we fails after hard work it does not mean we can not fulfill our dreams. However if we fails after a lot of hard work it means we have to try again. Because hard work will never waste so just keep trying until you reach your goal. So, we should never have to be afraid from the failures. It is good for us to learns more from failure and do better next time. Never give up on your dreams and desires. Try for your ambittions and happiness. One day you will get the success, as Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said that: ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""",7,7,8,8,7,7,2531,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

655,3001,72732FD01203,"""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". In my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you dont stop focused on, it will make you grow. The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life. My first reason that support my response, is that if you dont keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. If you keep trying your best and doing what you like to do you will grow each day. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. For example, some people have their goals but they dont try their best. My second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. The experience you have will make your future better. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you dont stop focused on it will make your life easier. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. For example, in my experience every time I know how to do something and I keep practicing, on it I get to improve myself. My third reason that support my response is that the more things you learn the more prepared your will be in your life. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it. To conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emersons statement. The more you know about something, the best future you will have. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow. Trying to do something you have experience with will make you grow.

There have been a lot of fights in Generic_City?.

657,3003,15AC952FFBC1,"Have you ever wanted an advice, but you ask more than one person. By listen different advice or opinion you have to ask more than one person. When people want an advice they ask more than 1 person because they want to hear different advice to make sure they dont make mistakes, and they want to hear the right an advice. I think people should ask for an advice to more than one person, because maybe the first person that they ask for an advice were wrong. For example, when I need an advice I always ask my parents first. I always ask both of them, but sometimes they always have different opinions, parents always have the right advice for you, but the problem is the sometimes they both give you a different advice. Sometimes they told you an advice that you might not like, or the one that you werent not looking for, and thats when I ask other people about advice like my teachers, friends, brothers, cousins, principals. just to hear what you wanted to hear or the right decision. Without a doubt, I would ask more than one person for and advice, to hear about others people situations. clearly, I would ask multiple people an advice because you never know whos wrong or whos right, but atleast people give you different opinios, so theyre giving you ideas about what you cant or can do. On the other hand if you ask only one person for an advice that person might be wrong, and you might to a wrong decison. People should listen to all the advice that people give to them.

For example, I personally like to ask my parents for an advice first, but sometimes I dont like what they say to me, so thats when I ask other people like my friends, sometimes you think your friends are right not your parents.

658,3004,7373B4F44528,"Have you ever accomplished something in your life? Because people nowadays are very lazy and hard headed because they are easily distracted by social media, people around them, and also the society thats why they cannot focus on their goals in life. Although some might argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish, actually it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what youve accomplished. One reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because you will gain more knowledge. For instance, based on my personal experience when I was in middle school, I dont do my projects, homework, seat works because Im too lazy and I just love talking with my friends everyday in our class. However, when I moved here in America last year things have changed because Im new here in this country and I dont know anyone. I realized that my friends here are not the same like in the Generic_City that I used to talk to everyday. Thats why I decided to study hard and make my parents proud again. I have an five As in my classes right know and Im proud because I accomplished something. And yes, Thomas Jefferson was right ""Determine never to be idle.. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something."" we should never stop doing something that can benefit us. This proves that working on something will help you gain more knowledge in life and dont stop believing in yourself. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my dads personal experience. My dad was a college graduate in the Generic_City, he dreamed to become a successful businessman and he made it. My dad started a business near to schools and shops so many people will go to his store. The first few months was amazing because his customers was very loyal to him my dad didnt expect that it will happen. Unfortunately, my dads business went down because something happened that he didnt liked. People are robbing and digging all the way to my dads store every night. Thats why he was forced to closed his business and rest for a while. After a few years he didnt have a job because he was still shocked to what happened to his business. However, he decided to take culinary class to work again because he wants to help our family and to gain more knowledge about baking. After taking the culinary, he went to Generic_City to seek new opportunity. He is now currently working in five star restaurant owned by a rich man in Generic_City. This proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish like what my dad did in his life and he changed for a better living. Another reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because people will be proud to what youve accomplished. For example, from the movie PELE it is about a young boy who dreamed to become a professional football player. He lived in a small house in Brazil and played football with his friends in his neighborhood. Pele was a poor little kid but plays well even he is very short unlike other people in his town. When they play against other teams, they always laugh at them because they dont have a proper gear for playing. And there is a guy who is recruiting players for their club. Pele was the youngest player in the club thats why he was treated like a slave. After few years playing in his club, its his time to shine to represent Brazil in the world cup. Pele scored a lot of goals and Brazil went to the finals. He was so incredible that time no one can stop him and Brazil won the world cup. This proves that you need hard work to accomplish something like Pele he never stop doing what he wanted to be and now people from Brazil and all over the world are proud of him. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish comes from Adidas quote or saying ""All in or nothing"". For instance, that line is very effective to people especially the athletes around the world because doing your goals in life makes you more stronger and better than the others. And you should give your best all the time and make people proud to what youve done in life. This proves that is it better to work on something to accomplish like the owner of Adidas he became famous and rich because he worked hard, focused on his goals. The other side will argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish because you will have more time to do what you want or something else. However, it is better to work on something because you can practice your weaknesses. For example, my friend Generic_Name who really dont know how to write a perfect essay but can speak fluent in English. He was really bad in writing essay when we were in middle school. Generic_Name was always shy to read or present his work to our teacher. So, I told him to work with my classmate who is really good in making essay and ask him to teach Generic_Name how to write a perfect essay. After a few weeks of learning, Generic_Name improved his writing skills. This proves that it is better work on something to accomplish like what my friend Generic_Name did he started practicing his weakness and became a good writer. Another example that proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my personal experience. For instance, Ive been playing football since 5 years old because my dad is also a football player. When I was playing with my club my coach said my first touch is not really good unlike the other players. However, I practiced by myself like what what coach told me. And my mentality was I should prove my coach that I will be a better football player. This proves that practicing your weaknesses will make you more a better person. To conclude all these statements above, it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what youve accomplished. We people have different purposes in life, we should never be idle in life.",8,8,8,8,7,7,1499,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Some person belive that is is a good idea for students to commit a career to young age. One reason is because the students can to learn more in a specifit environment.

My second year I take a math class and I discover taht I love math and I think that I want to continue to learn about this class. The other reason is it is bad idea for students to commit a career to young age because the student dont have time for fun.

So, if they know that they can use there cell phones in school they wont be using it during class hours. Cell phones are really use full to students during school hours. It keeps them safe and will help there education in how they will want to learn. You should really reconsider to allow students to bring there cell phones to school. It will be helpful to them. Students will think that education is fun now. And If you really look at it theres not much time of break or free time. The only time theyll use their phones a lot is during lunch time. Take my opinion and try it . Youll see that i was right. Our school will be fun for students our age.

663,3009,907FC59841EC,I disagree to school board adding an half hours to school each day. I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family and it takes to be with there family. some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family. Some students dont have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor. If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all of the student will not come to school half of the school year. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. I been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. I play sports so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school or I am not on the term anymore. To sum up I think school should be the some as it is or take sum time of school because is too long to add time to it.

Also failure is a common thing that happens to people, and it also help us to learn better from the mistakes, then giving up. For example my friend Generic_Name, he had 20 dollars in his pockets and he went to a game store to get the news video game at was only 25 dollars. But there was even a new updated on a game that he already have, and it was 10 dollars. And he wont get paid back until two weeks and the updated wont be availed until next week. so he went bought the updated game, but he didnt knew there was a sale on the new game on the online store that was only 16 dollars. But now he sometimes check to see if there any sales or deals before he goes to the store. For another example a old man said he bought a new car but realize it was missing some pieces. Then he started to look round the internet to see if any of the parts that he needs are buy able. So far there wasnt a whole all of the items for the car. but he didnt stop giving up that easily. But one day he find all the parts and fix his car. Also I had a friend who was going to the park, but forgot where is the park is and sometimes forget how to get back. Because he takes along way back home and to the park. Which he should take the short cut like I tell him, but he doesnt care, he like long walks. but one day he designed to take the short path thought the area, and he kinda like it its easier get to places for him.

In my opinion, it would be better to work alone so that you can focus on your work. In my science class, we always get the opportunity to work with partners. But i rather work alone and if I need help or dont understand something I can always ask my teacher. If you work alone you have a better chance of learning more and passing your final exam. Its good to work with partners sometimes. Although, you have a better chance of passing your class. You also get the chance to get good skills. Like to not depend on anybody for help, to be a leader not a follower. Before my uncle passed away, he told me to never depend on nobody for help. You have to climb the steps by yourself to get to where you want to be. I want to own a mechanic shop by myself when i am older. Ill work on all the cars by myself with no employees. You can learn a lot of skills by working alone. Everybody has different opinions,some people say working with partners may be easier and helpful. But you have to think about all the distractions and trouble making kids. Letting other students do all the work and then copying and take credit for someone else work. I use to be one of those kids until i noticed I am never going to learn or get somewhere in my life if I keep letting people carry me over my steps. To conclude,working with partners may be easier,faster and exciting. Working alone is a mans job,to not be a follower.

They arent dependent on other people when it comes to most things in life and know what to do to get past certain things. These people grow a lot mentally because they end up knowing a lot because they go through with the decisions themselves; they dont listen to other people and dont make their decisions based on what other people say. Self-Reliant people know how to get through their important or ""life changing"" decisions. For Example: Buying your own house, getting married , and dropping out of school are all very important decisions that you and only you can make. They think through about what decision they are going to make. People that dont make their decisions on their own always depend on someone or something else, especially when they are very important. You can learn a lot from making important decisions by yourself and it can help you in the long run. Self-Reliant people arent dependent on other people and always follow their instincts. They know making your own decisions is better than being guided towards what decision to make. Being Independent also goes in the same category as making your own decision. You do everything by yourself when you are independent, all the decisions youve made has either had positives or negatives for your life, asking someone for their opinion is only going to make you more biased to that choice. People should make their own decisions based on what they want/need to do for their life. Making your own decisions helps you grow mentally, every major decision youve made affects your life every day. Most people always seem to ask somebody for help on a very important decision, while others just think about what they should do themselves.

669,3015,1DB195AA7BE3,"Well the best option for my is what you attend the classes from home by way of online . My reason or my thought is, what you cant learn, in online classes, and thought what you can do it , doing others wor,k in you free time, and the school has good ideas for student what take, classes like after school just in home . So in my position is that because if you work so is you cant take the class for one hours, and you work ,and is more benefit for myself but ,each person has diferent ideas . Examples: If you not have work is more time for you ,for what you keep doing you class online. If you wnat the class . you has more time for to think best for work online and make a good work and your class. With this examples are much more for what you take any option or my option what is the best or most better already is in you home . If you not have time like time complete is for that what you take this option ya what has work and not time like for stay in the school all the time . Others examples is whent you have 18 year old has to much resposabilities and others case it s not easy . I think whent a teacher said you need that class is for one reason, and you nedd take that class but you cant took with you teacher what, is most better for you. So and my opinion or my position is take class from home in online, and to much better what ,take video coferencing. One reason because im take that option is because in my home is relax, and with food and alone and not voices and nothing, and in my home take my time for think most better i think is the most important for my work in home and i think what the work in online is not easy so need my time for to think, and good ideas and good answer, and the idea is what you learn with any option you take for this case . The student in this time has more option for any problem . One reason for what i take this option is for the time ya what much student are major or not have much time for coming a school because the work or others case. Other reasons what the student take this option is beacuse is home not in other pleace ya what not has ride or cars for take that class or classes en other pleace . My intentions is what others student take this option what is classes from HOME because is the best ,option for any case too if you want free time is more easy for you take this class or classes home by way of online, and is more choice that idea and minus dificult just what in home or online you not have teacher for explain any question so for that reason is little complicate but not impossible make you work so you cant do it , forever you want , nothing is this life is impossible but too not is easy everthing is sacrifice. Abd you has see you work good and past the class sin difucult . My reference is the option class FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE. Is the best option and more benefif for learn in home, and more easy for the time or others problem and i cant wait what everthing stay good for my cass or classes .

Because of praising students in a long times, it migt be would make them image anything that they want to do is all for others praise to them. Also, the achivement of students are only come when they can be self confident to face any hard works. The praise given is something that cannot be stay in one person foever, praise is to support students spirit while they become successful. First of all, praising students in a long times, it might be would make them think of anything that they want to do is all for others praise to them. Because students can easily get distracted by praising from others, they could not be focus to be themselves when theres too much praises for them. Students need to remember that people may give praise to bring them up and surely can bring them down anytime. So, students do not need to listen to anybodys praise or anything that is unreal. Otherwise,a better way is students should be believing in themselves that they can do well on anything hard works. Secondly, the achivement of students are only come when they can be self confident to face any hard works. Students should learn how to handle any hard works when they go out to the real life. They need to facing to real things, real problems and that is how they can be true self esteem. They cant be afraid or lose their spirit whenever they fail. Also, students can be achivement while they know exactly what they should do to reach their goal on the future. Student better know that people only remember to them when they become success, but if they arent no will care about them. Finally, the praise given is something that cannot be stay in one person foever, praise is to support students spirit while they become successful. Because the praise from others to them can easily forget very quickly. So students should know the goods and bads of the praise, it could bring students to more success when they know that the praise of people can helps. Students can be famous and getting praising from others anytime when they do something great or they can show people about how well their capability are. The achivement of people are not coming from anyones praise, that is about how hard they were try and what were they faced to reach their goal. Also only believing in themselves could bring them to the successful in future.

671,3017,2C8802241F51,"Doing More Work I think Thomas Jefferson quote he wrote ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" is right. I think that we accomplish more if we getting the work done faster working hard, and getting more people to always to work on it. Getting the work done faster can help. if we are working all day faster and faster we might get tired but people could get more stuff done. If we are building a house and we work on it everyday but some people are just working slow as they can it can take them a year and two but if they were going to work and working faster and faster they could get more done and even get more house to work on. Some people might say that even if Im working hard I still fail or just done accomplish of what Im trying to get but if that happens to me I would work harder and faster so I dont fail and and I would accomplish what Im trying to get. If you are working hard and always working you are going to get what your trying to accomplish. Working hard mean actually doesnt mean you have to wake up in the morning a go work all you have to do is when you go to work work hard and work all your effort. Some people say that I dont have to work hard to get what I want well in my point is if its a long time goal why not make it short term goal and work hard and hard. If its a short term goal finish it in a day if you believe yourself. Sometimes working alone can get boring and upsetting. I like to work with people that are happy and believe in there self, and they can get somewhere in there life. People like to work there friends that can distract them from what they are doing and they wont be able to focus on what they are doing. Even getting people to work can make everything easy and get the work done and get what you want to accomplish faster.

672,3018,C3E499B46594,"Althogh some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Nevertheless is it not a good idea for students, because they tired more early, bring more focus on some classes but not in the others, and they not take a break on summer. They can be tired more early because some time they worry for the work that they have . For example, students pass more time study and not take a break. Most students going to school sleep because in the night they study for exams, or make some proyect that they left. most of them have many homework and they not finish on time because they are tired and need to sleep to going with energy on the school though they are not finish the homework. In concept the students need more time to make the school work because if they take the offer to graduate in three years they need to give everything on time. Most of them bring more focus on some classes that others because they think that some classes are more important and the others not. Nevertheless the grades can be going down for the reasons that the students not put attention on classes, or not make the work. Also they need to make the work of the all classes because that importan, and all classes they need for graduate. This can be give them problems if they not make anything for they grades going up because if they have bad grades they can not graduate in three years. Clearly the students forget the importan that all classes are for graduate. The students not take a break on summer because they want to going the summer school for make more classes.

No matter how old you are being hounst is a very good thing for kids, adualts and teenagers. I think you should be hounst at all times because if youer not hounst people wont trust you, and people can come to you for advice, it also helps people with trust issues to know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst. If you are not hounst people wont trust you. Most people want to be trusted. People want to be trusted in a relationship, friendship and a parentship and most importantly you would want to be trusted in your family. Being hounst whould make people trust in you in many ways.

Therefore, after doing all that no one wanted to be her friend because they couldnt trust her. If you are hounst at all time people can come to you for advice. If your hounst your friends, sisters, classmates will come to you for advice because they would know you would have great ones. Mostimportantly they would trust you because youer hounst and they will tell you everything and ask for advice and you will tell them what sounds good and hounst .Therefore, if you hounst you can be trusted by good advice that might actully help that person.

Having trust issues can com from being dishounst and if youer dishounst with someone it really makes that person think that they cant trust anyone at all.

676,3022,71131D46F019,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. People think it is a good idea for students to have phones for educational purpose. I believe students should not have phones in classrooms because students could easily get distracted, they will not have the chance to learn better, and having a phone should be a privilege. First reason why I believe we should not have cell phones for educational purpose is ,students will get distracted. They will start using their phones for other purposes that are not educational or what their teacher has recommended. Students will start texting instead of doing their assigned work the teacher gave them. Students will start thinking it is okay for them to take out their phones when it is time for learning. Second reason i believe it is wrong for students to have cell phones in classroom. Students will not have the chance to learn how it use to be. Students that actually take notes have a better chance to memorize what they learned and doing better in tests. When teachers do hands on work during class students can learn and teach their peers. Last reason why i believe students should not have phones during class is ,phones are a privileged to have. Teachers should not allow phones during class time because students will not know when is the right time to have phones during class. Even if they put strict rules students will find a away to go around those rules. In conclusion, this is why I believe some schools should not allow phones in classrooms. Students will get distracted, they will not get the chance to learn more, and having phones is a privilege. I believe schools should not allow students to use their phones during class.

677,3023,B9B71CEE162B,"This is a very important important subject to me Thank You fore giving me the opportunity write about it. In my opinion i believe that graduating in four years is a lot better than, graduating in three years. The traditional four years of high school does not put the student under pressure, unlike the three year plan. The four year plan allows the student to have some elective classes. The three year plan helps students graduate faster but it also, it does not give people time to enjoy the summer or have free time to do their favorite hobby. High school is the best time of every students life, because in high school students do not have a lot of responsibilities. Students who decide to pick the three year plan will be making a big mistake. Students might not be able to have any elective classes, these classes are made to be easy classes that help student do their favorite hobby like playing guitar, piano and sports, these type of classes help students remove the stress from their brains by doing something they like. I am pretty sure that students who do the four year traditional plan will be doing better in school because they are not pressured, unlike the other students with the three year plan. I was born in Egypt i moved to the United States in 2015, which was my freshman year of high school. I had to take all the mandatory classes in my first year in order to be able to graduate on time. I was not able to take any elective classes, which put me under pressure and made feel bad, because of the amount of homework and the number of hours i used to sit in my room and study. Students in high school should be enjoying their lives. Students who do the three year plan do not have time to enjoy their lives with their family all year long, because they will have to study in order to pass their class and graduate. We all know that social life is important to every single one of us and, it affects how we do in school. Students who do the three year plan do not have time to do anything but study and do school related stuff which causes a lot of people depression and anxiety. Last year one of my closest friends had to do summer school, every time i call him he barley answers and says that he can not hang out because he got school related work to do. My friend used to hangout with me all the time but he did not because he had to go to summer school, he was telling me that he was not happy be cause he would wake up go to school finish school, go straight to work, come back from work do his homework and sleep, he barley had time to eat, which made him very tired mentally and physically. Some of the students in high school are independent, they live on their own have a job and dont ask parents for money. Independent students can not do the three year plan because the will not have any time to do anything other than work and school. For example i have a job i live on my own and i do not as my parents for any money or anything in order for me to do the three year plan i will have to quit my job, so i can be able to focus on school or else i will fail in school and not be able to graduate and if quit my job i will have no source of income to take care of myself and pay for my rent, but i do the four year traditional plan and i have a good job where i can focus on both school and my job so i can live. In conclusion the three year plan is not a very good decision to make and everyone should think twice before deciding on it. The three year plan does not let students have their free time to hand out with their friends or do their favorite hobby. That plan also does not give people time to have time with their family or the people they love. The three year plan will not give you time to have a job if you need one. I believe by going to high school for four years students will be able to get more experience and enjoy the best time of their lives.

678,3024,A9E9851F3E7E,"Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some parents think it is a good idea for students to stay at home for education. Students should not attend classes from home. Here are the three reasons why students should not attend classes from home. The first reason is students are just wasting time at home doing work, but they are really just playing video games or watching T.V. Also Most of the students that are home schooled can easily get distracted from Cellular devices too. What if the students have siblings, they might not have the time to do there work on time. Students at home may not have any connection. So, students will not be able to do any homework. The second reason is students can struggle with homework. Students can focus on doing there homework or class work. But what if students are blind and can not do any work at home. If a student is blind, parents would have to hire or contact someone to help that blind student at home for some help. A student from a different country may not speak English. That also can be a struggle for a parent or gaurdian because they might not be able to afford classes at home. The third reason is wasting money on books or classes. Most states have classes for free books or classes, but some other states might not. Parents might have not have the money for the classes or for the books. But wasting money on classes or books is not a good idea. Parents have to pay bills but what if the student needs the money for the classes. Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home or by video conferencing. Parents may think it is a good idea for students to stay home for education at home.

679,3025,9947BA6C3149,"The option of distance learning can be helpful for students in many ways. Internet have the access of having to take classes online or communicating with a teacher. Students can get the same knowledge in school or in their house but easier. Bullying is the major problem in school;however, teachers can avoid bully by having the option of distance learning. Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job. Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some students lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives. Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems. It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work. Having to wake up at the morning it is a hard thing to do for the majority of students, not having a good rest at night can effect students by ,grades, not concentrating, falling asleep at class, not paying attention,always been tired,or skipping some classes can effect when they graduate. In conclusion having the opportunity to do home school can make a big difference in a good way to the school and to the students education. That it is something that can be a easy way to learn and have the same knowledge like the other students, but in easier way. Internet have the access to many apps to help students can be a fun way to learn instead be sitting in a classroom for two hours. Students can avoid the fact that are some students that do not care at all and if they do not care about their live they are more possible not care about other student education. Going to school now it is something that some teenagers do not considerate important student can take any class online.

680,3026,E508BAFC3BF9,"Yes I agree with this quote, beacuse every students have a chance to learn, so in my opinion, I think that is a great opportunity, for all of them to learn. Some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. I think some of them they have a chance to surpport they family. Maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too. I think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress. First of all I think its would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you. Secondly if you have some family problem or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school. An other opportunity is if you go to college and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning fron 8 AM to 4 PM, and you job schedule is at 1 PM to 11 pm .

681,3027,D594B486E6B5,"People that have their faces in front of a screen with there back slouching with the help of technology. Technology is advancing year by year and month by month. When teens or adults get there hands on the new technology they will spend weeks or even months in their rooms, trying to figure out what the device can and cannot do. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives, because it can lead to bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive. However, not everyone agrees with this statement. Some people claim that technology has a positive effect on peoples lives. Neverless, this position overlooks an important point, mainly that technology cannot change how much human contact you have or do not have. For example, my friend she cannot drive, but she can have items get delivered to her; books, food, and clothes. Furthermore, when the delivery person came she did not know the proper way to greet him. Do to technology, people can have bad communication skills and they dont know how to communicate with people when they are in contact with someone. Moreover, by being isolated, technology can lead to bad communication skills. When someone gets the newest device or game, they want to know how it works. By learning what the device or video game can and cannot do, they usually spend a month learning how the device works or how to unlock the next level in the game. For instance, my brother got a new video game, he has isolated himself in his room, so he can beat the level and go on to the next. When he was finish with the level, he had a hard time communicating properly. Before he played his video game, his grammar was good; now it wasnt. For example he would use the wrong past and present tense. Thus, by staring at the screen for so long, he has got very inactive. Additionally, sitting on the couch or in a chair with a screen in front of you, every day for a whole month can make a person inactive. People that are inactive can become very lazy, and they intend on making a lot of mistakes when they are talking. They can also gain weight or have health problems. To illustrate, sitting in front of a screen while eating junk food can cause you to gain weight and can lead to health issues. During spring break, my friend had nothing to do, he was on his laptop everyday eating junk food. Now he has to be careful on what he can and cannot eat, because he will get heart burn. If he does not stop eating unhealthy foods in front of a screen he will gain more weight and have more health issues. He does not know how to ask for help; he needs someone to push him to go outside and enjoy the weather, instead of being in front of a screen all day long. Based on this argument, one must conclude that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives. Technology can effect us in many different ways; bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive. In conclusion, technology can change human contact in a negative way.",9,7,8,7,6,6,2976,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

683,3029,9C76CF46D791,"Students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. When students enter high school, they begin to work at a specific job to earn some money in order to be prepared for their future career. It is not a good idea for students to commit to a specific career at a young age because it will cause distractions from school work, students are still getting education, and specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy. Students should not commit to a career at a young age because it will cause distractions from school work. In high school, teachers and other faculties take education seriously and gets harder for students every year as they develop. Students get a lot of homework and tests they have to study for and need to focus on education in order to graduate from high school and get to a good collage. Spending time on a specific job before their actual career can distract students and decrease their grades. For example, a high school student goes to work at a salon after school but they have so much homework and a test to be prepared for, but they have dont have enough time to study and accomplish their homeworks since their specific job is in the way. So they begin to get a low grade and fail tests, which can also give them a low self-esteem. Students should not commit to a career at a young age because are still getting education. High school students are still young and are still developing, they need to spend their high school years to study and get a good education in order to develop. In their high school years, students begin to get an idea of what they wish to be for their future career, so they are still learning about it and thats how they get a better amount of money, be well-educated, and live a good and healthy life. For example, high school student is not well-educated and is still developing, so they need to keep studying and learning in school to graduate and get to a good collage to study about their future career that interests them and the dream job they are wishing to work for. A specific career will take them away from their dream job. Students should not commit to a career at a young age because specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy. It is important for students to do activites they enjoy to be healthy and have something positive and enjoyable to do. When they get a specific job during their high school years, it will take them away from these enjoyable and positive activities they and will have no time to do it when they have a specific career and school, which can also cause stress for students and will never find anything positive that they enjoy to do. For example, a student plays football and really enjoys it and it gives them positive energy. But they have to go to school and need time to do their schoolwork and study to pass. When they get a specific job, they dont have time to do their favorite activity and also not have enough amount of time to study and do schoolwork, which can cause stress to students. In conclusion, students should focus on studying and education in high school and not get a specific career that will distract themselves from school or any activities they enjoy to just to get money. They have to keep developing and study hard to get to a good collage and be prepared for their dream job to get a good amount of money and live a better life.",9,7,7,8,10,8,2083,"conventions 8, grammar 10, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

Do yo prefer a person whit bad attitude or good attitude?, think about it. In my position i agree with the statement, because; people get better communication with others, get more jobs, and students have more opportunities. Some people think attitude reflect self confidence to society, as positive attitude reflect peace and happiness. For example: When i have a positive atittude; i see more people want to know about me , but when i have a bad attitude nobody want to know me, because they know people with a positive attitude reflect more friendly, furthermore people with positive attitude have better relation with their family, friends and communitie as they energy is more pleasant. A positive person with good attitude get more jobs. In some companies a positive attitude is a requirement for the employer. People who have a positive attitude do better works. for example: I am waitress and my boss say all the time "" if you want to be a good customer service you need to have a good attitude"" and thats true because when i have a good attitude with the costumers they give me a good tips, but when i have a bad attitude i get bad tips. Customers want a good service, employer want to make good money and companies want a good workers. Some Schools want students with positive attitude.

Here are three reasons why seeking guidence from expercts and authorities is better than making desitions on your own. In addition, confusion is one of of the most common reasons why people end up making bad desistion. A lot of people might not know what it is going on or how to make a good desicion because it is probably their first time going through a situation they have never been in. I was not in a position to make my own desistions, because I was young and confused on what was going well untill I asked someone for help,but when I started making my own desitionsions Also, it leads you to do better when you communticate with others and gives you a better understanding on why making your desision with others helps you out more. When I began to speak out about my desisions to my closest friends and they helped me make me feel that I was not going through it alone and they always made sure that the desision I understand the desision I was taking before even making my next move. It honestly helped me a lot. Furthermore, it makes your life less stressful. You talked about what you were stressing about instead of bottling It all up. It is like some stress relive. For exapmple, you have a big heavey backpack full with books inside and when you get some out the way, you take some books out , and the backpack feels less heavy. I would feel relive on talking about what was stressing me out when I had to make a desision, because it is hard. In conclusion, Not only do you make a desision but you uderstand, you communicate, and you feel relived about your desision. In the end of the day you would feel not only good about your desision but sure about yourself and the people around you.

688,3034,9613CEAFE86E,""" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? In my opinion i think we as people accomplish a lot if we are always doing something. One reason is because in oder to do something or succeed in something you have to be doing something for that to happen. I feel like if people want something to get done you have make a change and stay determined just like what Thomas Jefferson said in his quote and thats very important to keep in mind when you are trying to achieve something and you wanna make a difference. In Thomas Jeffersons quote he says something that really makes you think about how in society today how people deal with some things. It makes you wonder if people are doing the most they can to accomplish something and it also makes you think to yourself if you as your own person are doing whatever is it you can to accomplish your goals in life. I feel like some people dont do anything to try to accomplish the set goals they have for themselves and they expect for that goal that they are waiting for to come to them instead of them working for that accomplishment. It shouldnt be that way but some people think life is like that also when there is a major issue going on in the world some people think that doing nothing is okay. When people witness a problem some people decide not to do anything and the issue will go away when maybe thats not the case in some situations. There are people that are dedicated to what they want and will always do something to accomplish or achieve whatever it is they need to achieve and i think that is really good because it just shows that you are determined to do whatever you can to get what you want in life. People that are very determined achieve so much that it inspires others and makes them feel like they need to do something so they can start achieving want they want in life. I feel like thats very important because if you dont do something to accomplish what you want then nothing is going to happen in your life and I know there are people that dont do anything and they have nothing good going for them. I feel like Thomas Jefferson was the type of person to stay determined and focused on the goals he wanted to make. He set goals and he made them happen he made things happen for our country and all that happend because he was determined and focused and he wanted to do something so he can accomplish what he wanted. Everything in life you have to work for it and do something about it. It doesnt just land in your lap everything you do requires you to work for it and the end result will be that you accomplished everything you worked hard for. For example I feel like a lot of issues in this world could be solved if people would do something people wouldnt be running for there lives because there is a war going on in there country if somebody would do something about it. There wouldnt be so much negativity and so much hatred if somebody would just make a change. My over all conclusion about this quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote is that it is important for people to actually do something and work hard and achieve there goal. When you put your all into something your hard work pays off and you finally accomplished something and thats all that matters. I feel like what message Thomas Jefferson is trying to give is that life is always gonna be hard no matter what but you always have to push yourself and accomplish what needs to be done. When you do that good things come in return and it does serve purpose in you life it always have and always will. I think that is what Thomas Jefferson is trying to say in his motivating quote and it really inspired me and i hope it inspires others as well.

After then, I would love to schedules live events where my fans can enjoy playing and meeting new people. Some Ideas I would like to add is have large station were they can eat and talk. Another idea would be for my fans to be able to meet me in real life and take pictures or autograph with me. The greatest idea I would like to add is to be able to earn ten-thousand dollars. You can be able to earn ten-thousand dollars by 1v1 me in a match. These event will only take places on Sundays which I will be putting it on my stream.

690,3036,622ECD91DA0C,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement is false because you cant judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them you find out how that person actually is. For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you cant judge a person based on their appearance. I think that how a person dresses doesnt determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone to express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change. In addition, when you become friends with someone and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they werent having a good day. Also, what a lot of people dont understand is that everyone have problems and they dont know what other people are passing through. Sometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are. For example, once I had a friend that talked really bad about a girl and I believed everything he said, but when I started talking to her, she was completely different from what this one friend had told me about her. In conclusion, people are not always what they seem to be and you cant judge them on how they look. I think everyone should first try to get along with someone and then, they can judge.

Do you think its a good idea for students to be committed to a career at a young age? Even though choosing a career at a young age gives you a early start on researching that career. Choosing a career at a young age is bad idea. Its been proven that even collage students change a career they want to major in. So when it comes down to committing to a career at a young age there is a high possibility that a student will change it down the line. Although there about to enter high school students still need more time on choosing s career. Students are 14-15 years old making chooses that even 18-20 havent even desisted on yet and dont even know all there interest and hobbies yet. Its been brought up that before students enter high school they should have chosen and committed to a career.

If we want to make our life easy or conferrable it is not help full. for example if we have a two hours expanding the school day its not helping us because the using our schedule. All school schedule is help full for all who attend the school. so we dont have to use the two hours expanding the school day. The energy of the four-day two hours extending schools extending is not help full for me so. The school follow the school management systems. we dont have to use the two hours extending police. because,it is not help full for who attend the school and who need more time for his/her class. fore example some student need more time to do the Home work, and assignment. its not helping for that kind of student, some student need more to understand . it mean it is not help full the four-day school week and the extending the school day for two hours. Finally the am disagree with this idea its doesnt help student and teacher in the other way. school have to follow his extending police.

Third, dancing takes alot of energy, so that means you have to have a good meal before you can dance. Streach your body so you wont pull a muscle, which can be very painful and sometimes can lead to surgery. After streaching, warm up yourself so you can build your stigma, it will help you when you are feeling weak and tired.

Thats great to some students learning option to take some class in home, for example, some people do others things to help in home one example is he/her work in some place to help his family. Other example, regularity students nope have the opportunity go to the schools because the students things they not equality or things he/her cant do anythings to learning. I support the way to some teachers or one person is working to schools or some people have permission to teacher to go the house the person nope lost any classes they provide. The another reason, Responsability, for example, the place where I born people need to walk a lot distance to go learning and graduation some teachers sometime they go to the house where you live to teachers somethings to you.

Im agree with this article because you already know what do you wnat to do and study to be a proffesional in a future just choose a career that you like it, and then do it. choose a career that you feel that you like it, and practice all the time for example; I like the mechanic career.

For example in this Prompt educators thinks that students do not seem to retain what they have learn during the year when they are coming back to school after their break, they seem not know about anything or forget about stuff, which is true people to not appear to be thinking about things that might stress them out, instead they try to have fun with their love ones, and of course try to read some books every other day or read the news papers so you wont be left behind on what is actually going on in the world, perhaps we might forgot about stuff younger people are faster learners and thinkers, can not be able to forget about important information that easy. Most of the students usually travels a lot during summer vacation out of the state or they like to visit different countries, so yes basically what im trying to say is that a longer break or summer vacation is a good idea for those in specific who travels far away so it can give them enough time to explore wherever they going to be staying, and this can even be helpful for students to learn about different history, experiences, explore and this are some stuff that they can even share with their friends in school or with their teachers, that it can improve more their knowledge. Being away from school just for at least one month it can really effect anyone, I think that this could be effecting on just depending on how distracted you will be during the break, some students cant even call it a ""break"" or ""vacation"" because some of them would rather to take this time to earn a little bit of money to be able to effort for their needs and expenses, or they might have responsibilities to take care of,Others likes to volunteer in community services or try to be involve in different activities that will keep you busy. In respond to everything i do think that having a longer summer vacation would be good enough to catch up as much as we can with our old friends and families maybe when we were in school we wast able to see them enough because some of our love ones live far away from us so we take our time to spend every little moment we have lost while we were way and it benefits everyone in general, not just for students.

Another reason is if youre sick and cant move around so you dont have to do anything then as well. There are many excuses for you not to do something. You should do stuff tho like the important things you need done. For instance go to a doctors appointment or get groceriec. Just because you dont have to do something all the time doesnt mean you shouldnt move from being an idle. You should never be an idle tho. You should always get up and get an excersise or cardio because laying down and not doing anything can also cause sickness in your body that you dont want.

There is a program that make you work with some older than you but how are you and the other person benefiting from this program. This are how the program can help you and the other person by: Learning how to cooperate with other people, practicing social skills and how rely on each other. One thing you and your partner can learn is how to cooperate with one another. There are people that do not like to work with other people and maybe one of those person is your partner. When you are working with someone else you have to cooperate because working together is essential for a good team. Without communication between you and your teammate, nothing will really work because you have to be able to express your ideas and understand your partners point of view, you have to work together so it can be a successful team so you will have to cooperate if you want it to work. Social skills are very important and you can learn or practiced them with you partner. People like to talk and know how to start a conversation with other people, but there are people that are really shy. People that are shy struggles with staring conversations or making their ideas clear. If you are a shy person and you are on the program, try to practice your social skills with your partner because I think that they are going to understand your situation and they will not judge you by that, so you should not feel uncomfortable. You can try to practice social skills or even learn new ways to start a conversation and be less shy. How to rely on other people is important. When you are with someone else and you do not understand something, you should ask them because they are there to assist you and help them when they do not understand something too. There is a limit on relying on other people because you should try to solve your problem but if you could not solve it, it is the perfect moment to ask your partner,otherwise, you will be a person that have a problem and it will be asking its partner all the time even if you could have solve it by yourself. There are limits for things, you should try because if you never try you are not going to be able to learn anything. In conclusion, been with someone older than you can be helpful because they have a lot of knowledge and are able to understand other people situation. What can both learn from this program is how to work to together, new ways to make new friends, or practice social skills and rely on someone to help you but not all the time because you should try first.",8,7,8,8,6,8,3821,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

Most students when they are not interested in something will most likely not do good in that subject. If you put students in those classes when they dont want to take then the pass rate may drop in those classes. The music, drama, and art class should stay as electives for students that enjoy those classes. I do see how those classes can help a students with some aspects on life but if they dont want to be in that elective then they wont be as involved as everyone else. School is meant for learning and not just putting students in a class they dont like, its not a good way to teach students. If the student have a choose in what they take, then will students find it interesting and will want to learn more. The classes students choose to take should help them get ready for there future career. I am opposed to having classes in the arts as a required class but I do believe they should stay as electives. Since I am still a student myself, I know what it is like to be put in a class that I do not finding interesting. I do not feel as if the school should have the right to choose our required electives. Student should have a choose in what class they want because it appeals to them and its something they actually want to take. If a student choose that class they then choose it for a reason. Thats why if a student gets something they dont like, they are no going to be as engaged in that class and not learn that much as well. A student should have a right not to take the classes in the arts and schools should not make it a required class neither. If school makes those classes required then the pass rate is going to drop and students will not want to attend school as much because they are failing a class they dont even like. The schools should keep those classes as electives and not as core classes. There are plenty of students that enjoy taking those classes and that do really good in them as well. The classes in the arts are great classes to have a option to take while in school, it opens so many doors for students that want to make a career out of those classes. Im sure some students learn a lot of life lessons while taking those classes and has helped them in some way. I believe you can learn a lot of skills in those classes as long as your engaged in them and actually like the classes. School should keep music, drama, and art class as electives so the people that want to take it can. The classes students take should help them in there future career. If a student want to take a class that he want to work in as a career, they shouldnt be rejected to take it because the classes in the arts are required to take. For example, if a student whats to become a construction work, then I do not see how taking a music class is going to help that student reach his goal to be in that career. The things students do now while in school can change there lives just by simply making them take a class they dont like. There are a wide range of classes students can take that will better prepare for when they leave school. The classes students take now will help them but if schools make the students take something they dont want to take then will it possible ruin them. Thats why students shouldn not be required to take the classes in the arts and choose in what they want to take. I dont believe schools should me the classes of the arts so be required to take. But I do believe they should stay as electives in the school. Students should be able to choose what they take in school and they should take something that is appealing to them. The classes to have benefits to some of the students and is a great elective class to have.

First of all I think It will be fun couplet a science experiment because I like sciences and I can learn more about experiment. Also I love going to my sciences class when we do experiments because It fun. I always laugh when I do experiment and they dont work. Another thing that I think sciences is fun is because you never know if the experiment will be work. One day me and my little cause we did smile in the kitchen and my mom gets mad and she make me clean the whole kitchen but, then we did smile in school and I already knew how to do it. Secondly when you are doing a science experiment You always have to work in groups sometimes with your friends sometimes not. For me its cool to work with different persons because when you do not know something and you ask them and they know they will help you and thats why for me is enjoyable to do sciences experiments because Im a friendly person. One day in my sciences class we were doing an experiment then a new student came and the teacher ask me if I could help him and I said yes because he just knew Spanish and I help him and we became friend. Then doing a sciences experiment it not just to have fun is to learn more about the subject that you are learning because is no the same doing the experiment then just listing to the teacher explaining. A lot of time this has happen to me that Im listing to the teacher but I dont understand nothing but when we do the experiment I do understand. In conclusion for me completing a sciences experiment is one of the my favorite things because we dont just learn we have fun and thats why I like it. Also to complete a sciences experiment you do different things you dont just stay sit you move around. At the being of the year I didt speak to much English and it was hard to understand the teacher but when we start doing experiment it was more easy and now I understand more and that make me feel happy and that one of the reason I enjoy doing experiments.",6,6,5,5,5,6,364,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
707,3053,6C802D3F5F2A,"One topic that is frequently debated is ""Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement"". Some people think, that praise that is given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. I believe that the source of true self-esteem is by praising a students work because that could help them grow more independent. By praising a students work, they are going to be able to; work efficiently independent, have a bigger self confidence, and learn better. First reason, When a students work is praised that helps them achieve there work more efficiently. It emphasizes that they are capable of working independent and being able to have a good job. When some one is praised for their work, it makes them feel good and makes them want to do more work. A students work should not get praised for their work if they didnt put any effort in the work because that would just make them want to not put any effort in the work, because they will think that they would get the same grade as someone that actually tried and actually wanted to get a good grade for something that they put so much effort into. Second reason, When a student has a big self confidence that helps them get their work done more constant and with more effort because they know that they can do it and that are capable of having a good grade. when a student is willing to put a lot of effort into the work. their work should be more praised. praising a students work can help them have a by self confidence, which can help the students learn more. when a student is willing to learn that is the true motivation that is considered being able to achieve more work and do it more efficiently and with more confidence. Third reason, When a students is willing to learn a lot and are always on track, paying attention, and turning in work on time. and always putting a lot of effort in school, those kinds should always be recognized and praised, because they show how mature they are and how willing they are to graduate and have a good job. If a student is willing to learn and put a lot of effort in work, that makes them mature because it shows how willing they are to learn. other students dont care if they graduate or not because for them being ""popular"" and not listening to the teacher, and disrupting the class and doing what ever they want it more important than learning and getting an education. Having a strong self confidence, being independent and willing to learn more are some examples of praising a students work. when a teacher shows an appreciation to their students it shows that they care about them and it shows that they are willing to help them carry on and push them forward and being their when they need it, and that makes the students want to go to class everyday and want to learn because the teacher is fun and knows how to work with students very well. and that is why it is good to praise a students work.

708,3054,3E6C6F1FE64D,"Imagine going to school and its your first day back from summer vacation and you walk into class with a weird impression that some teachers want to change because they know you can change the way you act or talk to other people. I think first impressions can be change because there are people that struggle to show how they feel so they have this mean impression towards people the cause of it might be parents divorce a lot and a family member passing. Some resources say that 50 percent of the population tend to give students or parents an impression that is either showing how they feel towards something. Firstly, changing an impression might be a challenge for some people but they said its impossible to change in my reasoning I think its possible to change someones first impression. You really cant give someone an impression if you dont know anything about them or if you dont know them. You cant always say ""oh their so mean"" until they know your background. The reason I say that is because most of the time its true most people would give an impression towards new students at school, but they dont know anything about the person. In reality, I disagree with first impressions are almost impossible to change because you can change that impression that people tend to have on there face. Secondly, there are other ways you can show your impressions if you dont want to show them. The first one is that you need to try to befriend them and make a conversation you never know you and that person might have a lot in common that you just didnt know to begin with. Your impression doesnt judge but its the way you show it because sometimes it led to making new friends, having good grades, and making your own decisions in life sometimes. Thirdly, I think impressions can change because nobody said anything about ""anything isnt impossible "" but a lot of stuff is possible if you believe there is. My reasoning to this prompt is that if you dont try hard enough to change the impression you have on your face then how can you make friends or how can you ignore what people are saying about you . Everyone can change especially their impressions you just keep trying and get to know the person. In conclusion, I think first impressions can be change if you act right towards people and how you treat others with your impression. Nothing is impossible if your dont try to change it or if you dont try to make a way to get people to be on the same level as you in the end. So I totally disagree with this prompt for saying that first impressions are almost impossible to change.

The military are always looking for people who want to join the force this three years will make it easy for them to employ some of the students in the army, air force,navy e. c.t. Some people are old to be in high school if you are 20years old and still in high school if they tell you that is four years instead of three years you will be kick out if that school and that is not a good thing. There are lot of ways that graduating younger better than graduating old you can finish school by the age of 18 and then still be learning but not in high school. if you beside to go to collage and finish your fours diploma or more you can that high school fours can be a disaster for the students. The three years program is helping the student to finish school early and making him/her responsible in life be ready for life early by going to collage and spending the rest of the year that they should have be in high school in collage or other work places. there are a lot of ways that you can get in jobs great jobs and stuff all because you are young. Some work places need young people to work for them if you not young or if you are that old they will not take you in that job or that work place. for example i was trying to apply for a job in the internet i went through all the documents but what i so was you cant applied this job if you dont have a high school diploma think about if you were homeless and you need a job as soon as possible and they came and said that you cant have this job if you dont have high school diploma you,and you need that job but you still have fours to finish that is not a good helping point. This program will help the student a lot in saving time in his or her life time and finish school in a young age that is a big advantage for the student to have more stuffs to think about in life and just being in high school . This program is gonna save you a year of high school .If i have the right to this program i will make sure i do all the necessary was that i should do to finish school i year before my actual year. That will make me finish school in a young age and start looking for a job or go to collage. It depends what you want to do when you finish but it is a great idea and a great program to join to it saves time ,it can enable you to quality for jobs that required jobs that consider age. If it was me i can spend all summer without having a fun with my friends and go to the program do all work just to graduate early is just for a summer . Other one is that staying after school and i dont see any difficulties in doing that .it will save you time and even money because some school is not for free you have to pay to be in that school and other said stuff to pay too. All that will be limited for just pay three years instead of four years. it saves money and saves time. Programs like this have to be stand and be form as a big low that every school should do. It will even help some of the parents because not all students ride the school buses some of them they are brought to school by there parents a pick them again after school is not easy and some parents are working they cant always do that if the three years stands it will benefit the parents too by the way .The contain of my paper is minimize the years in high school. it also helps in man y ways like saving time, saving money , i can even say saying gas too because some parents take there children to school very day so if this policy stands legal and all the schools in the area are doing it they gonna make things easy for both the students and parents .",6,6,6,6,5,5,778,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Being inactive can lead to health benefits, and also your not helping yourself in life, also there is no purpose. If not being active can lead to an unsuccessful life.

I am always doing something while I am in school, and I am not allowed to be on my cell phone. This will not help me pass in school, even after school I sometimes stay in tutoring for Math and English, because I have trouble. This will be true in school, sports, and in life like my mother tells me all the time. I have to agree that always staying busy will allow you to accomplish more in life. In my school, soccer also helps me stay busy, because I am on the team. We have to practice everyday to have a chance to win. I want to be the best player that I can be, and to do this I have to always practice. My coach tells me the more I practice, and the busier that I am the better condition I will be in for the game. Soccer takes a lot of energy and you are always active in the game and you need to be more active than the other team to win. Always doing something in sports allows you to be better. My mom told me when she was growing up that she was poor, and she did not always have food to eat so she picked mangoes off of the tree. She did go to school, but when she was not in school she had to always stay busy. She would go to her grandmothers house to wash clothes or sell some of the mangoes that she picked in the street. She was fifteen years old, and she had no shoes so she worked for rich people in their house cleaning. She tells me this so that I will understand that I have to stay active and she has worked hard to give me a better life. She gets angry when I try to stay in bed and not do anything, because I always need to be active to get somewhere in life. We achieve more when we stay active, and we always are doing something good. My goals in life are to go to school, and graduate from a college, play sports to stay in condition, and make a better life for my kids like my mother.

714,3060,8E64BE4119C3,"Schools offer different options of schooling, they have is Online School , Public School , Private School and also Video Conferencing . However taking classes from home wouldnt benefit students the same way Public School would benefit them due to the fact; Some students are visual learners, Students wouldnt have a big social life outside of their home , Students can slack on their own education an have no motivation and also they could be relying on Google answers when they dont understand the material. Students have different methods to remembering a material they have learned. Everyone isnt the same, Everyone has their own different techniques; Some people may be visual learners, They need someone to be speaking to them explaining step by step and some students just like peace and quite to figure it out on their own. Personally I am a visual learner for every subject, I would need my teachers to give examples and to go over everything to me step by step to learn the material the teacher is teaching. My classmate, Generic_Name has a different opinion, Generic_Name needs a quite place to concentrate and to think about his work rather than a teacher talking the whole class period. In Elementary , Middle school and High school they plan a lot of activities for the kids. Schools have dances, concerts and even field trips being home schooled you wouldnt be able to enjoy none of the fun activities the school would have planned for your classmates. Being home schooled you wouldnt have that "" high school experience "" everyone claims they love so much and would do anything to go back too. Being home school would also effect your social life for the real world. In school they might not have a class for communication but going to a Public schools does teach you how to speak up and communicate with other people you dont know and that would really be beneficial for the real world after school when you go into your career. On the weekend I personally hate doing homework, I like to think of my home as a lazy environment for myself rather than another school place. I think if kids were to be home schooled they wouldnt be able to concentrate at home the whole time they are supposed to. There would be no consequences for the student as if when they arent paying attention or just on their phones the whole time. There would be no teachers or administrators to be motivating the student to get to work, be on time or even get youre grades up. Being home schooled and doing online school they would start getting on the wrong track after some time. If my house for me was a school environment i would procrastinate my school work so much like saying "" ill do it in 15 minutes "" "" ill do it the next 15 minutes "" and so on to the point i forgot because i have no motivation for my work. Having no teachers or administrator around it would be easy to cheat. not understanding the material and not being able to ask questions your last resort is to cheat for answer. Students will find the answers then think they have a easy way out of online school by relying on Google answers. Students can also pay someone to be doing their work for them and manipulate other kids to agree and do the work for them. Students attending online school or homeschooling have a lot of ways to cheat for their classwork. I disagree that home school or online school would be beneficial for students because they wouldnt be able to learn and understand everything and to being able to ask questions, Students wouldnt have a social life outside of their home and not be prepared to communicate with people outside in the real world, Students wouldt have any motivation for their school work and start slacking off and lastly they can find easy ways to get out of their own work and having it done without them actually doing any work.

And other is they need to improve in their achievement, because they are not sure if this come from praise or achievement. Also students they has the last world, if they need to practice the things the some people thinking to the benefit for their self-esteem. 1. Reason some people dont has the idea if the students are agree or disagree, i think this is not the best way to improve in their self-esteem, because students they believe in praising but, this is not the option to learn in their self-esteem they need to focus in their achievements. even if some people belief on praising,they think this help students to believe in praising i think students believe in this source but is not the principal option to believe in praising they need to focus in their achievements, values and skills because is one the priority and purpose to believe in their self-esteem this ideas must be to help to lean focus. Students need to improve in their achievements, because some people are not sure if this come from, praise or achievements. I think this are two different thinks, also one is believe in religion, for example: I belief in Jesus this is praise they dont need to compare, but i dont dismiss this idea,because is good idea to students believe in praising. Another is achievement this come from the goals you made and the effort you did it for your accomplishments. Also students their has the last word, if they need to practice the things the some people thing, to the benefit for their self-esteem, but the two are good idea for instill students dont believe, if this is the correct option, also they need to make the best effort to practice the best way to help their career in the future. In conclusion the students dont need to practice thing that some people thinks,to improve to help and learn more about self-esteem, this is one the purpose to improve their self-esteem, this is optional in what you believe if their praising or achievements but this two different things, but is good idea learn both for better self-esteem to understand.

716,3062,D58980F5EC66,"I believe this would benefit students around the world, students would be able to attend classes from any school no matter where students live, this would help students who live far way from school and cant get a ride to school. Attending classes online from home would make it more comfortable for students. Distance learning is good thing for students that want to study in school around the world or get the best education, students can be at home taking some classes that their country does not offer. Lets say a student lives in France and the student takes classes from United States, thats a good benefit, because you are learning education from another country in a different way that your country teaches you. This will be good for students who live in different country temporarily and are coming back to their countries. The schools that offer distance learning are making life easier for some students who cant get education of they have to walk for hours to go to school. I remember watching a video about girls life where she explains how far she has to walk though the mountains for 4 hours just to get to school. There are students who cant get education, because of the places they live, like places that are cold or far way from the city. This a good benefit in the United States since theres is a virus called corona virus in some states people are already effect with it, schools are closing cause of that students will be talking classes at home. In school some students feel uncomfortable of working with their teachers or classmates, that makes students to stop working or lose interest on their work, but when they are home school students feel more comfortable, because they are at their house with their family, they feel more safe at their house and they can trust their family. In schools one of the main reasons why students feel uncomfortable of going to class is because some students get bully by their classmates, others get peer pressure to try to do things they dont like or be something they are not, making students not to be themselves. There was this famous video of a kid who was crying and told his mom that he wanted a knife to kill himself, he was just 7 years old, the reason why he wanted to kill himself is because many people at his school make fun him for being small, the students at his school were bullying him so much that he had to be home school and get therapist to help him get better and be comfortable. At the end being able to attend classes at home depends if the students like it not everyone would think this is a good benefit for students others would think that is bad for students to take classes at home, because students will not get the chance to be social with other, this will make students not be able to work or talk with others outside in person, because they spent so much time at their houses taking classes by themselves. I have friend who used to be home school, now he goes to a high school and because he was home school, he doesnt talk that much in school, he doesnt have that many friends, it takes a while to get to know him. Taking classes from home is only good benefit if you want to take classes from another school, cant go to school because of where you live or it takes too long to walk to school, and if you dont feel comfortable in school, those are the main reasons students would taking classes from home.

Im in favor of the online education because it made it easier for me to take my online classes at home and I can do my assignment any time I want to do it. The online education is also convenient for students in colleges; most of the students in colleges study at home because they dont have to worry about transportation, nor the gas money for their car. My brother is in college and where he lives they get a lot of snow in the winter, so it make it hard for to go to college. Now he does not have to worry about the weather because he can study for his classes online. Second, most people are now doing online jobs because the grown of technology.

One of my friend is a you tuber and he gets decent amount of money just form putting videos of him self on the internet. The way YouTube work is the you tuber up lodes a video on YouTube and if he gets a lot of views then he gets a lot of money. Another online risky job is buying and selling in stocks. One time I bought an online stock form the company Tesla and it was really good price, after three months I sold the stock double the amount that I bought it in the first time. When people buy stocks from other company is like having a percentage of the company that buyer own. The risky part about it is people never now when the stock will go up or down. Third, online shopping has made it convent for people to order everything online. The most popular online delivery is Amazon; Amazon made people lives so much easier by having everything delivered to their houses. When I order online I always order from Amazon this company has everything I need for me and for my family. Amazon also has fresh grocery that they deliver it for the costumers in the same day that they order it. In these modern days other stores are now delivering online, so people can buy their needs while they are at home.

720,3066,9DDBBA28EBD0,"I agree with Michelangelos words, because some time when we whant to do things we start a low level because we think we arent not good enough to do it, even known that we can do it good. And you think others have more opportunitties to have success and you would not have any of them, and it only matter how fast you can learn and how good you do them. One good example of it could be sports and I have had a time when something like that happened to me. These happened when I was at my last school Generic_School, I knew that the practices to try out for the teams were going to start in 2 days. And I thought about that I could make it to play with which ever one, but when one of my friends told me that a lot of students were going to try out. When he told me that I thought that wasent good enough and that others could be a lot better than me, so I decided to not try out and I was already playing for one team of Generic_City and they told that if I whant it I could play for both and I answered no. I didnt accept to play with my school and next year I did the try outs just to see if at least I have a good level compared to others and the coach saw how I played and he put my on Varsity team. I played almost all games I got a record, and I archieve one goal that was to proved to me that I could play at a high level even knowing that a year before I was scare to try out. Another reason Its that really frecuently that people got scared to try a challenge, and to show themself that they can do thing at a higher level than what they think. A similar expample is one of my cousins knew how to work in construction in El Salvador and he was really good at it, and when he just got here in US he knew that there was contruction sites and places that he could work on it. First he told me that we was excited and that he would get one of those joobs and somehow the next day he told me that he wasent getting it any more. That was not inetersted any more and told that he didnt have enough skills and it was going to be to hard for him. I told him that yes It was going to be hard but he had a lots of skills and knowleage about it and it would take less time for him to learn what they do there. He said he was going to think about it and after a time he got the joob and it olny took him less than a month to know how they operated there and got hired more fast than others, because he was doing a good joob on everything that he has to do. He told me that he was happy to take that joob and first he was wrong when he said that he had not enought skills for that joob. Also another reason of why I agree with Michelangelo is that I remenber that around 3 and the hallf years ago I played soccer just with friends afterschool and we played just for fun and to relax. I didint whant it to play for a team because I felt that I was not to good to play for them. One day I was playing soccer afterschool with some friends, and one of my friends dad was a coach for a team of Generic_City and remenbered that he said to all of us that if we whant it to play for him in his team. All my friend got in the team and I was the only one that did not got in, because I felt that I wasent good enought so i decided to not join the team. And for the next season he was loking for a goalkeeper and I accept it to got in because my friends convinced me to join. After I going and play my first games I sorprise my self and the team to cause I was playing a really good level and we won the league that season. For next season I got a record that was not receiving any goals in 10 games and that lead me to win the best goalkeeper in that season. And at the beggining of my third season our captain left ,and I got surprised that all all in the team want it me as a captain and my coach said that I was the captain of the teamI just got really happy. And won the league and the All Starts tournament that year and since there I have played like 8 season because every year there are 2. I have won for my third year in a row the best goalkeeper in the league. First no one was interested on my and after some seasons almost all team in Generic_City teams whant it me and teams from Generic_City I had like 7 teams that whant it me to play with them. In conclusion I strongly agree with Michelangelos words, its really common that the worst danger for most of us is to set our aim too low and achieving less than what we can do, I have had some reason and example but in all of them I realise that if I work hard I can accomplish more than I think I deserve.",6,6,7,6,5,5,2102,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
721,3067,F29244150DCB,"Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conference. This might be a good option for students who really do need it but there is some other students who wont take this seriously. I am writing this essay with the porpuse of desagreement with the idea of providing this ""benefit"" to the students, this is a way of making students lose interest in school because they might think that they dont have to take the conference every time and they willl think that they can do it whenever they want which gives to think that they arent prepare for making good decisions when it comes with schools classes. In my opinion this is an opportunity that the schools gives to the students to drop out of high school considering that students are teenagers and they dont have the same amount of responsability than adults in most cases. As a student I desagree with this option. We need to be able to communicate, create good group work, and meet people and I can assure that most of the students will ended up leaving this classes when they half way done. Being with more students make classes fun, helpful and even more interesting, students sometimes needs to have a adult teaching them and having a conversation face to face instead a computer taking to them. Taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time for example: My brother is a college student who is getting his master degree in Genetic Engineering some of his classes wasnt a requirement that he had to take them inside school so he decide to take them online so he can have more free time when it comes with work and school. He made a study plan which consist in spending one hour each day so he can focus on his online classes which helps him to study for every single of his classes. My friend Generic_Name is a senior on high school and she decided to take two of her classes online so she can have enough time for work, school activities, and graduation plans. She has been overwhelm with all her activities and assignments which it made her drop out of one of her two online classes, she said she felt like she couldnt do it by herself which it made her start getting bad grades in her school classes. Later she decided to take those classes in school so she can have her classmate help her in case she get stuck in a topic. I think this opportunity can make students get stuck and give up on school which it cant happen because we are the future. In conclusion this option has it advantages and disavantages which for some people might seems good and differentes but for some other this option seems to be useless when it comes with the progress that we do inside the school.",8,7,7,8,6,7,3592,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

723,3069,FE60E597467E,"What is positive attitude? Positive attitude is when a person has positive thoughts about something that went wrong or good, but they see all the possibles ways to success in life. Having a positive attitude is essential in lifestyle, this can bring happiness to your life, and can take you to extraordinary places. I think having a positive attitude is important because this is a way to express yourself around others, and to show the way you can manage your thoughts. I agree that having positive attitude is the key to success in life, and that everyone should have a positive attitude not just for a work area but anywhere. There are many reasons to have a positive attitude, for example: you may want to have a positive attitude when you get a bad grade on the test, because you can think positive and say: "" I did bad on this test today but, I am going to keep trying and studying hard every time so I can do better"". Another example is when you are doing a sport and you think you cant do it and that you are going to give up, you can tell yourself you can do it and have a positive attitude towards it. There are always problems in the daily life, and people deal with this problems not always with a good attitude. What will happen if you dont have a positive attitude? Well if you dont have a positive attitude, you wont have success in life because you are going to have negativity in your mind and the word ""fail"" is going to become one of your favorites. Having a positive attitude is not always easy, and not all people have it. A negative attitude is the opposite of a positive attitude, and this can affect your life. For example: In school if you have a bad attitude things can go bad, when you are always being negative usually your problems dont get fix and you struggle more with your thoughts. This can mentally affect you, and teenagers are challenged every day by this issue. The key is positively to a succesful life. I personally consider myself as a postive person. I try to solve every problem with a positive attitude because when I do so, my problems get fix the good way and I am happy with the results. If I dont have a postive attitude, all my goals would be nothing, I get stress and change my attitude, and I even hurt peoples feelings without knowing. Success is important too because by this you can be a better person for society, people can judge you differently and you can help others when they are going through a lot. Positively is also mental strength, it expands your knowledge, it changes the way you think about everything, and makes your life easier. In conclusion, having positive attitude helps you to have success in life. Sometimes its hard to understand how people can be so positive about everything, but not all people are happy in their lifes. Some people have their reasons to not be positive, and its important to understand these people. Other people, like me, have postitive attitude towards anything, which is good because it helps you in your daily life, work, school and others activities. A lot of people like other people with a positive attitude, because it brings positive energy and hapiness to other peoples life. Everyone should have a positive attitude, if you are not a positive person, its not to late to change the way you are living , and its time to have more positive thoughts and say "" positive"" for a successful life.

725,3071,876CDA4D152D,"Do you think that all students have the capacity to commit to a career at a young age? In this paper I will argue about how students do not have the ability to commit to a career at a young age. Students shouldnt commit to a career, because they can change their mind, they are not good at only one thing or they dont want to do anything. A lot of people I know keep changing their mind, they are not ready to keep doing only one thing for the rest of their lives. My sister is an example: She is now almost about to finish her career but she wants to leave it because now she is interested in another thing. When she was in high school the career that she is in right now wasnt something that she wanted because she didnt like it, she does now, but she wants to do other things. For some people is not easy to stick with something, because they will keep changing their mind. Since I was young I wanted to do a lot of things in life. I cant commit to only one career because there is so many things that I want to do and like to do, for example: When I was 6 years old I liked playing the guitar, I still like to play the guitar but it is no something I want to to as a career. At 3 years old I loved to dance, it is something that I will always like to do but that is not something that I see myself doing for the rest of my life. And when I was 10 years old I started to draw, I started by drawing animals or any cartoon character, but now I draw whatever comes to my mind, however, it is not something I want to keep doing. Since there is not only one thing I like to do I cant commit to only one thing in life and If i do commit, later in life I will probably regret doing it. There are many students at my age that really dont want to do anything with their life or they dont have the ability do it. Some drop out of school because it is no something they are interested and probably its something they are not good at and give up. Most of them just want to stay home and do nothing. They stay at their parents house, which is not bad, but they stay there and do not look for any job. Some look for jobs but it is not something they like, it is something that is easy and can get them money to survive. Some say that all students can commit to a career, but they are wrong because not all students have the same mind sets as other students. At a young age not all students can do a career. In the future most of the students wont want to stick to only one career because they wouldnt only like one thing, so they should decide when they are ready and really know that the career that they are choosing will be the one that wont get tired of doing it.

726,3072,B7C150A40F86,"It is known, that students truly enjoy the most they can any break of the year. Giving a break to students in the evening and all summer, is better for their process of graduation. That is why, students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating. First of all, since students have so much schoolwork and homework to study, they often need a break, so that way they can relax in their home and do other activities with their family that are not related to school. Summer is a season in which students need to go out in vacations and spend time with their family as well. Generally, not every students and their families get to spend so much time all together in the evenings, that is because of their routine. Most parents have from their jobs summer break, and they prefer enjoying it together with their children. It would be unfair for them to have to not enjoy that much their summer with their children just because the students have courses during the summer. Another reason of why students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating, is because after they graduate, they are more prepared for the career they decide doing. It would not be a recommendable period of time having three years of high school for students that still need to keep studying and preparing themselves for the career that they are going to study in college. The students can get more experience while they are reaching to their goal which is their graduation. In high school, every student should have at least an idea of what they are going to be dedicating themselves for the rest of their lives, and most of them suffer by not knowing what career to choose. Some students may say that they would really wish graduating as soon as possible, but the fact is, that by being in a hurry of getting out of high school with a diploma, they would make the mistake by maybe choosing the wrong career in college for themselves, or even maybe deciding to not go to college just because they did not have the enough time of high school to think and decide the options that colleges offer. Giving students more time for this particular decision is a good way to let them know what they are capable of doing in their future. In conclusion, students having four years of high school includes many benefits that can help them to be more prepared for college, rest more in summer, and giving them a better process of high school for their future in college and job. Students can challenge themselves by experiencing the traditional four years of high school and see the advantages of the result that they reached which will be very beneficial for them.

728,3074,BDAE1D4B6C20,"The quote, hard work pays, means a lot when it comes to doing something and one staying idle. The world today upgrades itself each and everyday,which tells us that we should always be doing new everyday as humans. Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times. There are a lot of chances one can benefit from been productive other than been idle. To start with, there are a lot of goodness in been productive than been an idle man. People who invest in their time to produce something meaningful are known across the globe because of their hard work and dedication. Due to how hardworking they are, they get the chance to explore new ways of doing things and new ideas that would help them in their next exploitation. For instance, since Bill Gates is hardworking man, he is known across the globe and due to this he has been exposed to other new things that would help him in whatever he is doing now. Again, when there is a football match between two different teams, and if one team is seen practicing so hard than the other, it would be considered that the team seen practicing the most would deliver more than the other team with no doubt. Moreover, doing something always makes an individual active and lives longer than been idle. A person who is seen to be doing something productive all the time is considered to be adding more years to his or her age due to the fact that working tirelessly everyday helps keep the body in form and shape which by so doing prevents diseases that attack people. For instance when a person walks about a half and a mile to work everyday, it is very difficult to see that individual get sick because the body is always busy looking for something to do. On the other hand, idleness brings nothing but retrogression and failure because youre not able to bring forth anything productive and therefore it becomes a waste of time,energy and resources. One can make the comparison so easily between a productive person and someone been idle, a productive person can always be seen advancing from one stage to the other while an idle person will be seen at the space that he is at always. Furthermore, when people say time is money, they are definitely talking about how one is able to use his available to produce something meaningful for himself to get money and have some other benefits as well. No one gets rich by just sitting at home, folding his hands and just expect something to happen. People may argue on this that one can make it in life when he or she inherits the possession from his family. This may be true because you may have everything to yourself but everything will be squandered if one does not work hard to top it up or add more to what he has. People choose idleness because it is more relaxing and the easiest way to go because you just sit there and wait for whatever happens to happen. Been idle can also affect a person in way or the other. In the sense that, if a person is seen to be at one place all the time, it may be considered that the person may be lazy and this may deprive him off certain opportunities that might help him in one way or the other. Last but not least, working hard or been productive gets one a recognition or a specific type of award that goes a long way in life. There is no doubt about the fact that people who work hard are awarded the most and are the ones that are shown to the world for others to see and emulate their footsteps. For instance, Usain Bolt has been winning almost all his race in the Olympics and it sends a good message about him to the world because of how hardworking he is. Due to this someone else can decide to emulate his footsteps to become a world star like him. Again no one chooses to be last in whatever he is doing but rather aims at the high spot. Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times. It always good to look at the brighter side of good and it is always advisable to go for what is right.

First, it could be rude to the staff that work their because of less human communication. How is it rude? Well think of it like this: someone is better than you at your job and you wanna be better, but you cant because the person youre going up against is a computer and knows mostly anything and everything on what to do in those situations.

730,3076,8DD09D4FCD4F,"Is attending classes from home by way online of videoconferencing a favorable method for students to study? Attending to classes from home by way online or videoconferencing is not a highly recommended way to study, because students will not have the same learning that they have while they are at school. If attending classes from home becomes a common way to study, students will not have the opportunity to build strong friendships with the other students around them, nor with the teachers. Also is not a recommended way to learn because students may not take their courses serious as they do in school because of the instructions of their teachers, or the advice of the counselors, or administrators of school. In the first place attending classes from home is not the same has being is school, because at school students take their homework, quizzes and exams more serious that they can do at home. When students are in class and they have any question about the topic that they are learning of the can freely ask their teacher and the teacher will give them a clear explained answer and examples in order for students to understand everything they are teaching them. In addition, if students attend to classes online they will not have the opportunity to stay after school for extra help, or to retake a quiz or exam, nor to attend to a learning center to have other students helping them with their homework; or to just study with the company of another student. As a matter of fact, students grades will decay due to not having all their questions answered, and their problems being solved. Secondly, if attending classes online becomes a common way to study, students will not practice their communication skills by not building relationships with their classmates, not discussing their concerns with their classmates, nor just having fun with their friends during lunch ship. They would not feel the same way because at school sometimes students get inspired by other students, they see other students not just as their classmates but also as their friends, they could even see each other as family, therefore, students with the time get to see the school as another home where they know they have people that could help them with school stuff, but also can give them personal advice, as counselors and teachers do. Moreover, when students are receiving classes online at home, they will feel bored, and also lonely because they will not have anyone to discuss their questions or doubts with. In addition, in our present a large percent of teenagers are dealing with psychological problems such as; stress, anxiety, and depression; being at school distracts teens from their problems at home or even at their jobs, and it is a great way to receive help and advice from people willing to help them; such as school counselors, teachers, and friends. Being in school is better rather than being at home alone just studying. Lastly, attending classes online is not the best idea for students who tempt to not take their studies seriously. While they are at home they wont feel the presence of a teacher standing next to them telling them to get their work done, or asking them to pay attention, and to not fell asleep during class. Also they will not feel the obligation to do their homework, in order to turn it in the following day. When students have to work in groups they learn lots of things from the teammates that they did not before, is a awesome way to inspire each other, and also to have fun, as students see other students work hard for their goals they do it too; but if these students are working alone they do the complete opposite. Therefore, this kind of students will think that they can do what they want and they wont take their courses in the serious way they have to be taken. In conclusion, attending to classes online is not a favorable way for students to learn because they will not learn the same way that they do while in school. The students will not work on their communication skills, nor their social skills. In addition, students will not take their courses with the grade of seriousness they have to be taken.

Extending the school day two houres and a four day school week aint a bad idea for people who needs more help and are focusing on their future and college. Do you think this is a great idea? Yes, because the more time your at school the more time youll be learning and getting help. If added 2 more houres to school on a four day school week, the more school work will be finished and learned. I think my school should fallow this model because in my opinion test and quiz scores will show a greater improvement over time. First reason why my school should have a four-day week school with a exteded 2 houres is because, many work can be done at school and teachers would have more time to explain details with deeper nolige. Teachers could have more time to study practice with the students before taking their test like using websites like kahoots. it/quizlit. live and notes so the students can feel confident of what they have learned. This will be consiting longer periods for every class that every student and teachers will have to make sure every student leave the school grounds successfuly and informed of what they have learned that day. Second reasons is that being in school for 2 more houres will help you work smoothly at every class.

Seeking multiple opinion can benefit you make new friends, have good relationship with your friends and make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion. Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you.

Althought some schools think that is better to offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, actually students should take four years of high school. First students can have more time to learn. For example, in a year students can learn much stuff, and they have energy to learn, in the summer students just have two months to study, so they dont have much time to learn all the stuff they learn at school, in evenings students have three months to study, the classes start a 5pm and end at 7pm, so at that time students are tired and the dont have much energy, so its difficult to concentrated and learn all the stuff. Second students can have electives, students can have classes like gym, art, and music students can discover new talents in that classes, also students relax their minds in that classes and enjoy the school. Third students can enjoy their summer vacations, students get tired for study ten months, is good that they can relax and pass time with their family and friends, so their mind is clear, and when they start study they have good attitude, energy and they want to learn new stuff. Finally students can have more time to do stuffs, because they can go home and do their homeworks, study for exams, pass time with their family, and have good sleep hours, they dont have to worry about go to school in evenings, they can relax.

736,3082,D5202DF530D1,"I feel like people making their own decisions will be a lot better for that person. But seeking guidance is that bad either for someone to make their own decisions says to someone else that they know what they are doing and can build something great with how their working and planning for the future. Although seeking guidance is the worst thing to do, i feel like people making decisions for themselves is better. For example if i were to go to someone for guidance or for something more and they give me some sort of guidance or idea and it turn out bad for me. Than i would never be able to go another person for guidance and ideas and i would most likely turn to myself. Then theres the problem that the reason that i went to seek guidance was because i couldnt make a decision for myself and now since Im self reliant it will be hard for me to make my own decisions. Now if i didnt go to the authorities and experts and made the decision for myself but it still ended up being bad outcome. It still would have been a lot better for me so that i can use the experience of making my own decision to help make better one in the future. Now if you go to the authorities and experts to seek guidance and it it come out great and now your life is going great. Until the time to make your own decision it will be even harder to make then the time you went for guidance. That you yourself will fell behind and lose whatever chance that you had because you never made a decisions for yourself and thats problem some people have because they have been going to someone else to make your life decisions. In conclusion to go somewhere to seek guidance isnt bad its what comes out of it to help you if it turns out bad or good it will effect your decision making to be better and worst. In my opinion making your own decision will be better then any expert ideas because it help yo in your life and what comes after every decision you make for better or worst.

737,3083,25F1B2374A32,"Have you ever felt like you needed the guidance of another person? Many people have felt that way. Its never bad to ask for help or guidance from another person to get through things. Although having your life runned by someone else, seeking guidance isnt such a bad thing, because for some people making a big decisions on their own could be hard and stressful, and you could also be guided into a good and healthier life style where you are making better decisions and ideas. A reason people should seek guidance is because for some people making a big decision on their own could be hard and stressful. But having someone there with them while making the decision would be more than helpful and could possible reduce the stress they have. For example my cousin would get very stressed out when she had to make big decisions on her own. But when she had someone there with her or she asked for help she wasnt as stressed as she was when she had to decided on her own. Making decisions on your own is hard and intimating, so why not seek the guidance of someone else to help get though that tough decision making? Another reason seeking guidance is a good idea, is because youd be guided into a better and healthier life style where you are making better decisions and ideas. As an example one of my closest friends was going through a dark time in her life and was making poor decisions. But she found someone she looked up to and asked for their guidance. So they guided her to a better life style, where she now makes better decisions than she did before. All because she had someone to guide and help her. Guidance really does play a big role in a better life style and better choice making on people. However one might say, ""well your life is being runned by another person."" But it really isnt being runned by another person, because you also have the choice to listen to them or not. Or that your mentor or whoever is guiding will tell you what to do or how to live your life. In some cases they do tell you how to live your life, but they tell you how to live a better and healthier life, but cant force you to change in any way. Having your life runned by someone else isnt ideal but seeking guidance isnt the worse idea because youd be guided in good ways such as a better life style and could be guided through big hard decision making. In conclusion I believe peoples lives wouldnt be horrible with the guidance of someone because they arent only guided you to better your life but they are also helping you with hard decision making and getting through things.",7,7,7,8,7,7,501,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
738,3084,75DAA54880C1,"The author Ralph Emerson wrote, To be yourself in a world that is constlantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. I totally agree with Emersons statement because be something else is not the most greatest accomplishment that you can do, the most important accomplishment that you can do in this big worl is always be yourself, be humble about everything, be kind with others, and never change the person that you really are. First, bring humble is one of the most important thing that we always need to have no matter what. Being humble can take you to the top, to be successful in the life. For example, Marisela de Montecristo, is a salvadorian beauty queen, who wob the title of Miss Universe last year and Nuestra Belleza Latina in 2013. Marisela grow up very poor, but when she was 10 years old, she emigrated with her mom to this country looking for a better life, however, when she came here she went to the school, she learned English, and she did graduated in social communication. In 2013 she decided to compete in a reality show that is called Nuestra Belleza Latina and she won, and with all the money that she won, she decided to founded an own restaurant for her mom in Las Vegas, Nevada. Six years latter, she decided to compite for Miss Universe El Salvador 2018, where she resulted the winner. That year she went to Thailand to compite for the title of Miss Universe. Now she is a famous person and she have her own foundation that helps people in countries around the world like Africa, El Salvador, Mexico, Philipines. Also she is modeling in differents countries like Paris, Spain, and Great Britain, but above all this things that shes is doing, she always still humble. In one interview with Telemundo, she said that being humble is the key of being successful in the live, and I totally agree with her. Second, be kind with others is something that defined you as a good person, because people love when someone is really interesting in help others. For example, I think that we should be kind with others, help others, because we never know when we going to need help of these people, in addition, being kind is other accomplishment that you can do in this life, and is something that you can feel proud of be. Third, never change who you really are for something passenger or for something that can not give you happiness, because be yourself is the most important thing that you can do in this big world. For example, my mom told me that being myself is the only thing that can make the difference of me between everyone, she also told me that being gay is not a hindrance to triumphing in my life, because with effort, dedication, and persistence I can do many things in my life, without necessity of change the person who I am. To finish, be yourself is the only and the best thing you can do in your life. There is not other way to be happy and to demostrated to the world that you dont have to be something else to be successful and to make greatest accomplishment in your life, because the key always is going to be be yourself and be proud the person who you are.",7,7,6,5,5,6,1534,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Success is failure one, two, trhee time. You are a human without loss enthusiasm is hard because some people have not enthusiasm to do the right things dont have power and are weak when herad something bad. Im agree with him because to be a successfuly in the future your going to failre a lot of time. I have a friend that told me to get success in the life have to to fail and dont loss enthusiasm. For me fail in my life is not something really bad, but just a little bit, you can keep getting good without problem. This is a important role because all people can think what they have to do about failure and how they can be preparate when their enthusiasm is up and later is down. Failure for me is not a mistake because by those mistake you learn and you can be better person. Some reason to be agree with him is that is true, you have to fail first and happens what the happens. Some people are not agree with this statement because they think that if you fail you going to be bad and your enthusiasm going down. Support ideas is not easy because this world have different kind of people with different kind of mind. Good examples to be success is do the best thing and if you fail dont say nothing to nobody, just do it and that sit. Some teenegers have the same problems everyday because when they are fail they think that something happen going to happen to them but they are their success to consist of going from failure. In my conclusion Im going to say that if you want to success in your life is necessary to fail because you learn from experience, you going to do everything right. For me in my future Im not going to say nothing about failin g because Im going to be calmly because I knew that with experience could be preparate for my problems.

751,3097,93385DED39E7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. When i was 15 years old, i broke my leg and that made me incapable of going to the school for 3 months, during those 3 months i didnt get any support to keep track on my classes because the school i was attending didnt had distance learning; Consequently, i almost failed my school year, because of this i support the option of having distance learning. The fact that some schools have the equipment to offer distance learning is motivating, because it gives an opportunity to teenagers that struggle to get the education they need and this can be for several reasons that can limit them to get to their schools such as a medical condition, being isolated from their schools, or any circumstances that can happen during the school year; Furthermore, having distance learning as an option that is beneficial to the students and to the schools in general. Students who are having problems to get to their schools, for factors such as not having money for the transportation or the schools are located too far from them, will benefit of having distance learning. For example, if a student cant get to his school because he cant afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems. Students who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state. For example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that cant arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school. One of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several countrys around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment. On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply dont care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice. In conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student wont be able to assist to the school.",9,8,8,9,8,7,1951,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
752,3098,11402548A471,"Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement? True self-esteem comes from praise because it can be motivating to students,it helps them want to learn more, and it helps the student to achieve any goal even if the work is not the students effort. one reason why motivation can help a student build self-esteem is because when you feel that youre not able to do something, but if you have someone whos there with you, you are motivated to keep on going, to keep trying harder until you achieve the goal that you want. For example, the first time that I took the W!SE test I didnt pass the firs time and I was close to pass, but I had my mom who told ""dont worry youre smart and I know that you will pass the second time"" and those words motivated me and it helped me to studied more and then when I took the test the second time I passed. Therefore, motivation can help students to build self-esteem and to achieve any goal. Another reason why praising students can help build self-esteem on them is that they may want to learn more if they got someone whos always supporting then and help them to keep trying, for example, when I was in elementary school I used to get really bad grades, but Ive always had my mom who has always supported me in anything and she told me that I could get better grades because I was smart to achieve any goal and it helped me to keep learning and I was motivated to get better grades, in middle school I started to get good grades and now in high school Ive got better grades than I used to get in middle school, therefore, praising students helps to build self-esteem on them and it help them to want to keep learning more. In addition, praising students can help them to achieve any goal even if the work is not the students best effort, it helps them to keep trying harder even if things dont go well and it helps them to never give up. For example, English is not my first language and It was hard for me when I came to America because I couldnt understand anything, I couldnt communicate with other people who didnt spoke the same language as me. When I first came to America I didnt like to speak English because it was hard for me to pronounce each word, but I had to learn English to communicate with other people. I used to cry because I couldnt understand anything, I couldnt even say a word in English, but I had people who always told me not to worry because I was smart and that I was going to learn English that really helped me to build self-esteem on me, I dont speak English perfectly, but now Im able to understand and to communicate with other people. Therefore, it is important that we got people who are there to support us and to motivate us to keep trying hard no matter how hard it is or how hard it looks. Praising students builds self-esteem on them, because that gives them motivation to keep trying hard to achieve any goal, it motivates them to keep on going and to learn more each day, with people who motivates students, it does not matter how hard things are, they just want someone who is there to support them in anything. There are some students who dont like giving up, but sometimes if there is nobody who helps them to keep going they will stop trying, because they need motivation, they need someone who is there whenever they need them. My mom had always supported me and I know that she always be there for me, she will always motivate me, that builds self-esteem on me because I know that I have someone who will always support me and that helps me to keep trying harder and to never give up. If we got people who praise students, then theyre going to build self-esteem on them.",8,8,8,8,7,8,238,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Im not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students dont have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they cant play anymore, till they make a good grade. This change can do a good change because the students that play a sport or if they are in the band, and if they care more in the activity that they play, maybe that can be distorting the student, that can be the reason of why they dont have good grades, so the students what the students have to study at the same with their sport or other activity, and be good with both. Maybe the students are better in their activity because sometimes we have more fun, and because we like to be in more movement.

754,3100,791AF7B78178,"My position about this prompt is that students should not take the program that allow students to graduate them in three years, because is not like taking normal classes, for example what would happen if students get to take the program that will allow them to graduate in 3 years? They would have to take more classes in less time: Because as I read in the prompt there was one part that says ""for students in order to graduate must take summer courses"", and this means that they would not have a break in this time. Not because of the time but for those students that would decide that they would not only risk to fell some classes but also not to take elective classes during summer because thats what this prompt says. It will be more stressful: As we all know school sometimes can be stressful but imagine how stressful if for students that graduate in four years as every other normal programs that high schools offer, now imagine how it would it be for students that take programs allowing them to graduate in three years. Ill say they have to work even harder, during the summer they have to take courses in order to be upgraded to the grade the are going to, also a lot of SOLs test will be taking in less time, Im not saying that those people wont have enough time to study, but what Im saying is they would have a really busy schedule with all their classes plus all of those tests coming up it wont be easy for them. The reason that why I used those examples to explain the main idea like this, it was for you to understand that such as that program it can be very difficult for students, not just that but for students that might not be quick to understand new subjects or new units, it can get them stuck in there with no option but to get into a point when they would just give it up and quit because it will get really hard for them. Now that I showed you how hard could it be for students that would take a three year high school program, now it clarifies that theres no need to rush with education and that students should take normal high school program because it wouldnt be so hard as taking the other program that I just talk about, in conclusion students have more changes to graduate with a four-year-program, as long as they keep themselves in track with what they are suppose to do it wont be no problem, and there will be less stress for them, more freedom to take a break when they need to, and enough time to study.",6,7,6,7,6,7,1588,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community. I think those students who say community service takes too much time they should just give some time when they are just sitting their in the couch and go help out your community and the environment.,7,5,7,6,5,6,913,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

People will judge you and,also you might not be cool enough to have friends. But at the end of the day you have yourself respect. I agree that you should be yourself. Because you should be proud of who you are ,and will be succes, happy, and do what you good at. Some people say, Individally we are one in order to be one only you got be proud of who you are ,nor letting anyone change you. For instance, first when I moved in here in 2016 from Egypt. I was a 14 years old. It could have affected me. When people were making fun of my English. because I did not know how to speak It ,and did not know the culture. Which It was hard for me. But I was proud of me self for trying to learn ,and still Im learning everyday something new. Its a good feeling to feel proud of yourself.

They might laughe at me for not smoking ,and not being cool . However, I think of who Im if I do not like doing something. I should not do it because someone else is doing it or to make other happy but not myself. Some might say, I disagree you should not be youre self. Because other people can not be them self or might harm them self in a way. such as doing drugs,skiping school, not being respectful to youre family ,and friends.

Yes, yes they could be changed because first impressions dont justify who you are as a person and some people dont act the same when you first meet them. However some people are really judgmental about first impressions and could block off any type of relationship they had with you being job related, maybe girlfriend or boyfriend, and friends. First impressions are serious which drives a lot of people insane. Because they dont know how the people are going to react to them but, its okay that doesnt define who you are as a person. A great tip of advice is being able to read a room that means how people are acting in certain time and place. Like whats the vibe and mood if you should be more relaxed, goofy,serious etc. If you can read a room first impressions will become a lot easier because you will know how to act. But thats not the only way to have a good first impression most people dont act the same say on the first date,its probably going to be awkward and silent because you dont know how to act verses seeing someone for the 5th time.

761,3107,09EC2F6B0D24,"What if i been asked to share a lesson with elementary school students example .My lesson will be about what they want to be when they grow up . and how will they make that become true? One reason that this is important is because students need to know what they want to be and what they want to do when they grow up so when they go to school every day they know what they are working hard for. For example when they go to school they are going to be thinking about why they are in school for and how can they make their dream become true. another example is that they are going to be ready because they all ready know what they want because every day they went to school and they ask them self what do i want for my family? ,what do i want for my life ? why am i doing this for ?. they will not forget why they are in school for because they will have a goal for school. Another lesson I will tell them is that they need to do do their best in school because when they grow up they will need it on a everyday life. A reason why they have have to try their best in school is because when you grow up you will need it for everything you will need math,reading, writing and more .One example is that when you go to pay a bill you will need to know how much you need and how did it add up to all that amount of money and you will know how to because you went to school and you tried your best everyday you went. Another example is that everywhere you go you will need to read. This is why elementary school students need to know what they want to be when they grow up and why is important to go to school. And is important that they have good friends that will keep them going and to cheer them up because they might feel lonely and is not really good for them and everyone needs a friend that will help you when you need it and do let bad friends make you do bad things and you know what is good and what is bad .If you tell elementary school students what they have to do when they are small they will be better people in the world.

763,3109,DC5DAF538DF2,"During the World War II, most of the people were influenced by the behavior of the people. For instance, a lot of people choose to follow the anti-Semitic politics of Hitler and the Nazis because they were afraid of the death because the Nazis convinced them to follow them. Indeed, by setting a good example you success to convince them because you use both of the major things to influence, the feelings and the acts. You try to reach his heart by the sensitivity and by the concrete you show him that it is easy to do it. In this way, when you are setting a good example you are using the feelings of the people in order to show them the better behavior to adopt. The fear, the happiness, the solemnity can influence a choice of a person and that is why it is the better way to persuade. Through the fashion, the advertisements, the politics the sensitivity is always utilized to change the mind of someone. The behavior is the only thing that can help someone to change their opinion because trough it you can transmit all of your feelings to your speaker. Furthermore, people can be persuade by acts more easily than by words. So, by setting a good example, you can also influence people by showing them the better way to do something. Although people disagree with philosopher, physician, and humanitarian like Albert Schweitzer and affirm that there are better ways to convince someone, people should consider that to set a good example is the better way to persuade somebody. Firstly, the behavior is using the feelings to convince people. Indeed, whatever things you do to influence someone you use their feelings. And this is the best way because the feelings are something that stay in your mind and touch you directly and can let you do things even bad. The first example is in politics. A politician who takes a solemn tone and does a serious, and sad speech will influence your opinion and by modifying your state of mind he will transmit these feelings to show you what he wants you to think. Martin Luther King said: ""I have a dream"" so immediately you know that this dream is something anchored in his heart and he will give you all of his arguments to persuade you. Then, the second example is advertisement. As well as the fashion than the TV shows, each publicity lets you feel so be it fear, so be it happiness. They carry away people with them in their opinion and by choosing beautiful musics or pictures they help the spectator to feel the good vibes that the actors or advertising want to give you. Secondly, by setting a good example you can convince people to do acts. The first reason is people of our generations need to see to trust someone. And this is the reason why you need to show the example to someone to help him to trust you and give him the directions to follow. It was always easier to speak instead of to act but people want to see to know this is the better choice. For example, when you are doing shopping most of the girls prefer doing it in the shop instead of in line because women want to see their clothes to try them and be convinced this dress or this shirt is the better. The other reason is that you always want to have a concrete thing. So when you show the example you demonstrate that what you do is possible and affordable to you all and you encourage them to do it with you and this is what influence others. You give a proof of concrete and the speaker only need a little bit of will. For example during an humanitarian mission, if you are the leader of this one you need to show them the example not only with your behavior but also in what you must accomplish. If you are here to rebuild a public building you will do it with the volunteers to help them and lead the group. To conclude, the example is the best way to influence people for two reasons. The first one is obviously the aspect of the feelings. The transmission of a posture or opinion can help you to do a choice. The second one is the aspect of the concrete part. You give the example of what to do and the others can do it easily. Finally, there is not better way to convince people as Albert Schweitzer said. Because there is only one way which combines feelings and action and it is the good example by your own behavior.

766,3112,5FC3C342E64E,"I agree with this statement because you are capable of doing anything you want. Just because you have mastered something it does not mean that you cant do anything beyond what you have mastered. Having to master something can be a very big accomplishment to people including myself. Mastering one thing is good but mastering more than one thing is a huge accomplishment. Everyone can go beyond what they have mastered you just have to try and never give up and you will have mastered anything you want. Mastering something takes time and dedication its not just something you can do over night. It might take days, months, years who knows how long but at the end pretty sure it will be worth it. There are many things people can be mastered at such as teaching, playing football, etc. Just because you have mastered one thing it does not mean that you should be done mastering other things beyond what you already have mastered. If i were a NFL superstar it does not mean i cant go to school and become a doctor also when you retire you would have something to do. Thats an example of what you do to go beyond what you have mastered. Some people are born with skills and for them all they have to do is fully master it. Mastering is a skill that allows you to personally get a hang of what your best interest are. If you want to master something there a variety of ways to do so such as go to college or a camp etc. Mastering something is not very easy it takes time and dedication thats why doctors take approximately 12 years to get the highest degree in becoming a doctor. I strongly agree with author Ralph Waldo Emerson cause if you dont master beyond your intentions you will not grow. This is true because there are many things to do in this world to not be mastered at only one thing. What it means by you will never grow up is because you will stay at the same level Intel you unlock your full potential. This is a great quote for someone who was trying to master one thing in there life but after reading this quote it will help them realize that they can master more than one thing. This is a example on if you become a master at one thing and get lazy you will never grow up cause you have only mastered one thing in your life. Life it self is a precious gift and special skills are to so take advantage of it and learn as much as possible. So if you go above and beyond what you have mastered you will be a good and grown person. Its good in life to be good at just more than one thing cause it will help you in many ways such as getting jobs or getting in to schools. If you have more than one skills you could do anything you desire in life which is a good thing.

769,3115,046C6FB91CBA,"Distance learning can be very helpful to students who cannot attend classes at school like other students. Although distance learning can effect students losing focuses in their classes, nevertheless, learning away from school can help us the students to have less stress, and giving us an opportunity to take care of our brothers and sisters and attending classes without skipping classes. Almost everyone in school is stressing about something,so attending classes online would help a lot. For example: It gives us more time to finish our work for other class and stress less, because to me having the advantage to attend online classes would help out a lot, and also i might have other classes to worry about. so having an option for us the students to attend class from home by using online or video conferencing might not sound the worst. And could help students who are suffering from anxiety and having any type of stress. By using online classes they could listen to music to clam themselves down and not having any signs of a panic attack, because in school not every class or teachers might let the students use their phone to listen to music; they might not be able to know if the student is having a panic attack, but at home if they are attending classes online and having a panic attack their parents would be there to help them clam down. Most students need to stay home in order to help with family emergence. Research has show that almost 50% of the time if the student is not at school, then they are at home helping out with their siblings at home, doing that they skipping school and losing an education, but with online classes they can do both without skipping class or missing anything in school. Because with online class the information they need would be provided to them, if they have a laptop or computer and in case they do not have any of these technology they can just go to their local Library with their siblings and do their assessments with no worries, because their siblings would find some kind of fun to do at the library. In conclusion attending classes online at home would benefit a lot for us the students because in case some thing happens at home they just go online at do their work without stress about losing points, to me personal attending classes online would be very helpful because I would have to stress a lot, can skip school and get some sleep.

Schools should be the same, they could have more time to do their homework and rest, because there is stress in children. In the majority of middle schoolers and high schoolers there is always stress and preoccupations about grades. Most of high school teenagers stress and worry about colleges if they got in or not. And by taking the four-day weekend we are reserving energy and resources, by not driving cars or motorcycles because of the toxic smoke a vehicle throws to the air we breath. Sometimes some of the big businesses become of abusive or peoples hours to get extra work done. It should be peoples decision if they want to stay extra hours if they want to get their work done. People work to live and not live to work they somehow got to look for ways to provide themselves and sometimes their families. If they were to finish their jobs with everything done , they get to go home and be with their families. Having the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it. People need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically. Working too much causes stress and grueling because thinking too much about work and worrying about the bills that they have to pay. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work. In conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. Working for 10 hours is more then enough for a person. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldnt worry about but they have to if it envolves them.

If we doing something everyday we could accomplish something like if you exercise every day with healthy meals you will be losing weight and burning calories, if we do not do nothing and dont take care of your self youll gain weight, see stretch marks on your body or even get diagnosed by diabetes or even something even more serious like a stroke, heart attack, and organ failure. Everyday people accomplish things for example: work people who work in construction have to work through some harsh conditions when its freezing or when its flaming hot. From my experience of working in construction I was a laborer working for ten hours, I as a laborer had to make sediment, mix for placing cinder blocks, carry buckets of water, cinder blocks, fill in the the holes with concrete, had no breaks only lunch, set up scaffolds and lift long heavy wooden planks and climb up and set the pallets of cinder blocks and water for the mix so it doesnt dry. A Japanese manga artist named Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, even though both stories are fantastic but the one who stuck out the most is Dragon Ball. a young Akira saw a manga tournament who had the best manga it took him a couple tries to win and that lucky day he saw a editor from Toei Animations and told Akira great job from there he got confident and inspired that he could make something happen. later on he kept making mangas until he made one called dragon boy and one other manga and he combine both them and created dragon ball, he created Goku the main character and gave him the personality of Akira. Akria sold more than nine million copies of dragon ball from that money he made a studio call Bird Studio for his animations. Once Dragon Ball got so popular in Japan Toei Animations bought the anime from Akria and made the next Dragon Ball series called Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball has been around 32 years since it released in the U.S. and it still going and getting more popular. This year in January 14 the new Dragon Ball Super Broly came out in the U.S. and made one hundred million in the box office, one of the most famous anime and one of the best selling anime movies of all time.

772,3118,0AAD73A0AA91,"I think working in a group is more efficiently and helpful then working alone. In these paper i will argue about the benefice of working in a group. Working in group is better because we can share ideas, prepare us for the real world, and save time. If we work in groups, we can share information, ideas and thoughts. We can see what its better for our teamwork and the assignment that we were doing in school or jobs. I think the most of the jobs in the real world are in groups, however, when i work in the mechanic shop with my dad and brothers, an im replacing a engine, i need their help because it takes strange, agility and experience to replaced it, because its really hard for only one person to do it, so its important to learn how to work in group, these skills prepare and help us for the real world by working like a team or family group. The army, police officer and government are some good examples of groups, they work together to finish their work and see the benefices of working in group. Doing work as a team is not a waste of time, we share the responsibilities,so it would not be the much work for only one person. Two or more people is a good combination of beneficial and fast work. some say that working alone is better then working in group, but they wrong because when we work in groups is more easy by sharing thought with friend and partners, we get to now each other and makes new friends, that is the way how people get better in life by working in groups.

Jefferson wanted the world to become more active in life whether if it is a physical. Being active has many positives. Activity in society can help people reach their goals, help society, live life to the fullest, feel good and use time wisely. In this world people have big reasons to have activity life for example, they need one work where maybe all the time they are move for this reasons and more I think that the people need one activity life. Small actions like recycling or participating in community this help to disperse a good life for you and for the other people because people look that you have one purpose in the life. The life is hard, you need activity, you need to learn new things all the time, and never you be a inactive person because if you are a inactive person you not have good reason for live in this world. Inactivity is not good for your dreams or goals in the life because if you have one dream about buy a sport car, the car is not coming if you not work hard to take the money for the sport car. Nothing coming so easy you need effort, and dedication the inactivity not help you, the essence of the life is to crate good reason of live and work for yours dreams and goals. The idle person is a person how not have activity, That person maybe not have dreams or goals or maybe your dream is be idle, but the poin is that a idle person not have reasons for the society, not have support for your community, and he or she is lost in the life.

776,3122,23958A3106EA,"The work in group will always have an excellent results. I feel working in group have several benefits than working alone. When we hear that we are going to work alone it sounds good but not for all. It should be great for those people who dont have the capacity to work with others. Even you do not believe it, working in group is feature that no all humans have it. Why I think like that? because working with other people we help us to learn different types of job, we can able to work in others areas with others folks, we can meet amazing people. To begin with, working in group can help us to learn different types of job. I have my own experience with this. When I started my first job I didnt learn enough. I worked in a hotel and people there liked to work alone. Sometimes I didnt know how to do something and I immediately asked but those workers didnt like to teach others, and they said you should learn by yourself. Obviosly I didnt agree with them and I started to find different job where I could learn more. Working alone was the most diffucult job Ive ever had. I couldt learn from others because they didnt give me the opportunity to do it. Now I got experience from others how to work in restaurant, markets or shopping centers. I think you will learn hundred percentage better if you are learning from others. However, some people claim that work alone is more beneficial to concentrate, but I insist that work with someone else with leave you more knowledge than work alone. To continue, if we worked before in commuties or in group we are able to work in different areas of work and also work with different folks, it will be easier for us. When we are looking for a job in our interview the boss or managers will always ask if we have problem to work with others. They ask this questions because they want to be sure that we will work in different places and we will interact with the other employees. If we anwser NO, Im really sure that we wont get job soon. If we are willing to learn and work together as a team well have success in every job that we get. If we change of jobs is because we are looking for something better, and we will achieve working in different areas learning diffrente jobs, acquiring experience from others, showing that we are able to work with others, all these can be beneficial for us when we are looking for job. In addition, we can meet amazing people working in group. When we work with others we are making friends. My mom found her best friend Generic_Name in her job. They have eleven years with this beutiful friendship. Everyone needs a friend that can help, teach and learn with you. Think about it, there are more benefits working with someone else than working alone. Even though some people say that working in group is more complicated because you will find people who dont want to teach how to work or it can be distracting for you. I feel sure that there are more people good than bad and also if you know your work, you know what to do in your job there arent people or thing distracting for job. We should be responsable with our job this is an important thing that you shouldnt forget. In schools, in works or in the street well find amazing people who will help to improve our skill as workers or as humans being. To sum up, working in group will help us to find better jobs, to learn new thing, to interact with different people. Here in The United States we will find many jobs, we are able to learn many thing and also to interact with different people from different countries. Do not reject the opportunities to grow and accomplish your dreams. If some day you have the chance to teach others, do it with patience as a proffesional worker and keep in your mind that two heads think better than one.",8,8,8,8,7,9,472,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

How it will change up your future, how it will impact on your kids, how to treat with others, and also the idea of understanding someone better. Take them with us to the place where we practice our own religion, tell them the truth and advantages of it, and also show the religious cultures. We could impress people towards our government parties to support us by voting us. Promise them that we would not let them down, we will accept their wants and help them to advice it, we will make their education department strong that everyone can get education, and we will make sure that we provide them their dream jobs after they graduate college.

I am experienced with most Microsoft products that they have made through out my whole life. I am also experienced with Microsoft Software that they have created. I should be elected to work with Microsoft because Ive been using Microsoft products through out my life. For example I use there gaming console, laptop, tablet, and there desktop. I have experience with Microsoft products and I know how there system works. Ive study how they first made the gaming console and I also study how they made the Microsoft tablet/laptop. Ive been buying Microsoft products through out my whole life and that shows that I love there products and it shows how supporting I am to Microsoft company. I dont just use Microsoft products I also study the products and how the system works. An average person would just buy the project to use but they care less how the system works. In the other hand I care how the products works because its interesting. I also fixed broken Microsoft products therefore the only reason I knew how to fix it because I learned about the products and Ive studied them. My second reason why I should be elected in Microsoft Engineering is that I am very experienced with Microsoft software and programs. I use Microsoft software on a daily base because I use there software to work on something or to study them on how the software works. Most people use Microsoft software, For example Microsoft Word. People use word too type an essay or something really important. Most people know how to use Microsoft Word because its built to be simple, but in my case I know more tools and know more stuff about the program. Ive studied most of the tools that Microsoft has to offer in there software and trust me there is a lot of more stuff you can do with Microsoft word then just type a simple essay. Most people only know the basic tools in word and that proves that they are not interested in the software then just to do a quick essay. I have studied most tools and all Microsoft softwares. Ive taken classes to learn about these tools and more about Microsoft programs. It taught me a lot of stuff then an average person. The Microsoft Industry most likely want people to know how to use there programs and softwares because they are most likely going to make the employees use the programs. Some people may disagree with me that you dont have to be experienced with Microsoft softwares and products because they think in order to get the job they will have to spend money to purchase Microsoft products and there monthly programs. They also may disagree about me having to know more tools and skills about Microsoft softwares is a better way to get the job. I will say they are wrong because in reality most jobs would prefer people who are experienced with there product and software because then they dont have to teach a lot of stuff to the new employee. It also shows that they where interested in there product even way before they where interested in the job. Most jobs I will say want people who are experienced in there products because it shows that you enjoy there company and it shows that you will do great things for the company. Better and skilled people equals faster progress and thats what companys want. I should be elected into Microsoft Engineering because I endure the company and enjoy everything that they have to offer. I am skilled with most of there software and most of Microsoft products. I will do great things for the company and make the company better then ever. ",7,7,7,8,9,7,3226,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
